### OverviewThis summary synthesizes the key arguments and findings presented in “Return to Lacan: an approach to digital twin mind with free energy principle” by Lingyu Li and Chunbo Li. The paper investigates a novel framework for modeling the human mind, integrating the principles of the free energy principle (FEP) with Lacanian psychoanalysis. The central claim is that FEP provides a universal law for modelling living systems of any scale, and that Lacanian psychoanalysis, with its focus on the unconscious and the symbolic order, can be formalized within this framework. The authors propose a “digital twin mind” approach, leveraging this integration to create a sophisticated computational model of the human psyche.### MethodologyThe authors’ methodology centers around a recurrent generative model, designed to mimic the dynamic interplay of the three orders – the Real, the Symbolic, and the Imaginary – identified by Lacan. This model is built upon the FEP, which posits that living systems actively minimize their free energy by predicting and interacting with their environment. Specifically, the model employs variational inference, a technique from machine learning, to approximate the intractable calculations involved in the FEP. The core of the model consists of three interconnected units, each representing one of the Lacanian orders. These units communicate with each other, exchanging information and adjusting their internal states based on the observed environment. The authors highlight that this model is not intended as a literal representation of the brain, but rather as a conceptual framework for defining the system of current interest. The authors also emphasize the importance of the temporal structure, incorporating the concept of “logical time” – the non-linear, retrospective way in which humans construct their experience. From the perspective of logical time, “the past anticipates a future within which it can retroactively find a place”. In other words, t...

Abstract
Free energy principle (FEP) is a burgeoning theory in theoretical neuroscience that provides a
universal law for modelling living systems of any scale. Expecting a digital twin mind from
this first principle, we propose a macro-level interpretation that bridge neuroscience and
psychoanalysis through the lens of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis. In this article, we
claim three fundamental parallels between FEP and Lacanian psychoanalysis, and suggest a
FEP approach to formalizing Lacan’s theory. Sharing the non-linear temporal structure that
combines prediction and retrospection (logical time), both of two theories focus on
epistemological questions that how systems represented themselves and external world, and
those elements failed to be represented (lacks and free energy) significantly influence the
systems’ subsequent states. Additionally, the fundamental hypothesis of FEP that the precise
state of environment is always concealed, accounts for object petit a, the core concept in
Lacan’s theory. With neuropsychoanalytic mapping from three orders (the Real, the Symbolic,
and the Imaginary, RSI) onto brain regions, we propose a brain-wide FEP model for a
minimal definition of Lacanian mind – composite state of RSI that is perturbated by desire
running over the logical time. The FEP-RSI model involves three FEP units connected by
respective free energy with a natural compliance with logical time, mimicking core dynamics
of Lacanian mind. The biological plausibility of current model is considered from
perspectives of cognitive neuroscience. In conclusion, the FEP-RSI model encapsulates a
unified framework for digital twin modeling at the macro level.

Introduction
Cognitive computational neuroscience proposes an ambitious integration among
computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence, with the goal of
explaining neuronal activities and cognitive functions utilizing biological plausible
computational models (Kriegeskorte & Douglas, 2018). Computational models formally
define the process of brain representation, by solving which on computer, corresponding
process can be imitated, called computational simulation (Durán, 2020). Studies in this field
have proposed various computational model of specific cognitions ranging from perception,
object recognition, action, and memory to language, social cognition, and consciousness etc.
An appealing idea which naturally emerges but remains elusive is to encapsulate existing
models of these intertwined cognitive functions and hence assemble a digital twin. By
mirroring physical life, digital twin can help tracking health condition, detecting and
repairing potential problems, and predicting future status (Tao et al., 2022). However,
intruding challenges in a digital twin for human-mind rooted in its nature as a complex
system, including but not limited in heterogeneity of multiple modalities in their functions,
structures, scales, and hierarchies, unknown connectivity patterns among various cognitions,
and the lack of interpretation theory.
Free energy principle (FEP), a burgeoning theory in theoretical neuroscience, provides a
general and formal solution for modeling living systems at any scale ranging from neurons,
brain regions, cognitive functions, and individual and collective behaviors (Isomura et al.,
2023; Piekarski, 2023). Leveraging FEP, current work formalized Lacanian psychoanalysis,
hence offering a potential approach to digital twin mind at the micro level. Lacan’s theory
represents an extremely complex interpretation of psychic dynamics, which are treated as a
composite of three orders – the Real, the Symbolic, and the Imaginary (Evans, 2006). These
three orders cover most cognitive modalities, depicting the perceptive and linguistic
representations of self and the world. Based on the fundamental parallels underlying the two
theories, this article introduced computational Lacanian psychoanalysis and a roadmap
toward a digital twin at macro level.
Lacanian psychoanalysis
Lacan is renowned for his sophisticated theory of psychoanalysis, deeply rooted in
philosophy and linguistics. At the core of Lacanian psychoanalysis are the three orders: the
Real, the Symbolic, and the Imaginary (RSI). These orders serve as a fundamental framework
for understanding where the human subject resides within their mental states. According to
Lacan, an individual's mental state is a blend of these three domains that influence the subject
simultaneously and interdependently, akin to a Borromean ring. The Imaginary represents a
perceptive and internal representation of the external world. The dynamic interplay between
the external world and the internal self leads to primary self-identification and self-
knowledge, though inherently distorted due to its ‘imaginary’ nature. Consequently, the
identification within the Imaginary is essentially a misidentification, forming the basis for
psychosis (Mills & Downing, 2018). The Symbolic encompasses the language. Put succinctly,
since the "unconscious is structured like a language," the Symbolic operates akin to
Hermeneutics, addressing issues of meaning generation, self-interpretation, and
intersubjectivity. Hence the Symbolic is linguistic representation of the situations of subject.
However, it's important to note that any representation is inherently incomplete, leaving
aspects unrepresented. The Real collects the unrepresented, thus existing as a realm of
‘impossibility’, a missing reality. Derived from the Real, the concept of repetition—manifested
as an incessant attempt to represent the unrepresented—becomes another fundamental
concept of Lacanian psychoanalysis (Feldstein et al., 1995).
The temporal structure of those representations is logical time, a notion that human
experiences cannot be neatly confined within a unidirectional and chronological
understanding of time. From the perspective of logical time, “the past anticipates a future
within which it can retroactively find a place”. In other words, the past bestows significance
upon forthcoming events in an anticipatory manner, and the future imbues the past with
retroactive meaning. Along logical time, meaningful relationships between events emerge,
transforming time into a mechanism that generates significance. This concept underscores the
anticipatory nature of human mind and emphasizes the importance of retroactive
reconstruction (Hook et al., 2022).
And what drives the ongoing evolution of the three orders within logical time?
Repetition, as mentioned, serves as the driving force. For Lacan, repetition represents the
return of something that maintains identical—object petit a, a concept rooted in the Real,
leading to the endless metonymic course of desire. And orientation of drive is the running of
desire towards object petit a. The history of subjectivity unfurls in the repetition of desire's
trajectory: the unrepresented → object petit a → desire → object of desire → failure of
representation → the unrepresented. That is, desire can never be satisfied, and the endless
cycles contribute to so-called fantasy that need to be traversed by psychoanalysis practice. A
minimal definition of the human mind from Lacanian perspective ultimately emerges —
composite status of three orders which is perturbated by desire running over the logical time.
Free energy principle
To survive, living systems must interact with environment, including precepting and
changing it. Free energy principle (FEP) provides a universal principle for modeling these
interactions between environment and organisms at any scales like neuron, brain region, and
individual and collective behaviors (Isomura et al., 2023; Piekarski, 2023). Similar to Kant's
notion that we can only perceive phenomena and not the thing-in-itself, the starting point of
FEP is that precise state of the environment is usually concealed (referred to as the hidden
state), and living systems thus can only infer the hidden state through observations. The
entity implementing inferences is defined as internal model within systems, and FEP
formalizes the mechanisms of internal models.
In classical Bayesian theory of perception, the belief of the hidden state is defined as the
posterior belief according to the Bayes theorem:
𝑃(𝑜|𝑠)𝑃(𝑠)
𝑃(𝑠|𝑜)=
𝑃(𝑜)
For each observation 𝑜, the internal model infers the hidden state of environment
according to existing knowledge on the hidden state, known as priors 𝑃(𝑠), the likelihood of
this observation 𝑃(𝑜|𝑠), and the overall (marginal) probability of its occurrence 𝑃(𝑜). This
Bayesian account successfully explains various psychological domains like perceptual
constancies, perceptual illusions, cue combination, and multi-sensory integration etc.
(Rescorla, 2021). However, the computation of marginal probability 𝑃(𝑜) is intractable in
complex situation, which significantly hinders the computation of accurate posterior and
hence the biological plausibility of basic Bayesian cognitive science. To reach a more efficient
and plausible computation, FEP reforms it by involving active predictions and variational
inference.
Before precepting, the internal model keeps generating predictions of the forthcoming
phenomena 𝑃(𝑜|𝑠), based on priors 𝑃(𝑠). Therefore, the internal model is also referred as a
generative model. Now, the living systems are no longer passively inferring the environment,
but actively mirroring the world with its internal model, and predicting what will happen
next. Therefore, the Bayesian inference is turned into active inference. Additionally, the goal of
living systems is no longer to compute the accurate posterior according to the Bayes theorem,
but to optimize the internal model which can fit the real world as well as possible (Figure 1).
This optimization process is formalized by variational inference, an approximate Bayesian
inference from machine learning (Blei et al., 2017). In the context of variational inference, the
term under optimization is called evidence lower bound (ELBO), and in FEP, variational free
energy equals to the negative ELBO (i.e., maximization of ELBO is equivalent to minimization
of variational free energy).
Figure 1. Active inference through generative model mirroring the real world.
Originally a physics concept, free energy quantifies the energy available in a
thermodynamic system to alter its properties, and system with minimal free energy implies a
state of equilibrium. In the context of active inference, living systems with generative models
could get rid of repetitive Bayesian inference on exact posterior, but just focus on if the
predictions match observations. Only those mismatches are fed back to the system and draw
attention. In other words, mismatches induce the non-equilibrium state of generative model,
which can be quantified by its variational free energy, gauging the ‘energy’ required to
optimize it. Therefore, an optimal generative model that fits the environment best minimizes
the free energy. FEP depicts a same process as the second law of thermodynamic defines –
spontaneous process decreases the free energy of the system. Hence, free energy principle can
be seen as the physics of mind, both in its form and content (Schoeller, 2019).
Unlike machine learning models of variational inference that merely fit the potential
distribution, living systems could change the environment and collect evidence by actions.
Therefore, FEP further expands the context to action planning or decision making. That is, the
distribution of real world can be changed to fit the internal model. The desired distribution of
hidden state is defined as the preferences 𝐶 . For every conceivable action 𝜋, the anticipated
state of the system 𝑠̃ is the conditional possibilities 𝑄(𝑠̃|𝜋). Again, the best action will render
the state of environment fitting preferences. The term under optimization in decision making
is the expected free energy. In essence, expected free energy is a “belief that one will minimize
free energy in the future” (Parr et al., 2022).
From object petit a to free energy
Basically, we could summarize several consistent philosophies between Lacanian
psychoanalysis and FEP. First of all, both theories’ scopes focus on epistemological questions:
how knowledges or beliefs are acquired and how they are validated. By hypothesizing an
internal model that continuously generating simulations and predictions of the world, FEP
caters to the modernist transcendental constitution of the experiential world which is created
by human rather than found (Sass, 2015). A resembled simulation process also exists in
Lacan’s theory in the form of psychic reality and physical reality. All perceptions, actions, and
beliefs of human are referred to subjectivity – a psychic reality that separates subject and
environment (Mooij, 2012). Psychic reality generates expectations, intentions, and ‘fantasies’,
which are constrained by physical reality, and mismatches between psychic and physical
reality causing perturbation in the Real order. Mild mismatch induces emotional unpleasure,
while severe mismatch could be encoded as traumatic memory in brain, limbic systems and
insula especially (Dall’Aglio, 2019; Solms, 2019). From the view of FEP, these two reactions
can be seen as the performance and learning of internal models.
Temporal structures of both theories are combination of prediction and post-diction.
Interestingly, the two notions are literally aligned: “belief that one will minimize free energy
in the future (Parr et al., 2022)” & “the past anticipates a future within which it can
retroactively find a place (Hook et al., 2022)”. This non-linearly temporal structure is
biologically plausible both in real time and long scale. In real time perception, neural systems
approximate the present using predictions, and prediction errors are propagated back to
correct and overwrite original representations (Hogendoorn, 2022). At a longer time scale,
such a temporal structure contributes to sense of agent, conscious intention, and counter-
factual inference and so on (Miyamoto et al., 2023; Riemer, 2018).
Another significant similarity is the central role of ‘prediction errors’, those failed to be
represented by internal models. FEP describes living system’s behavior as an optimization
process to reach the precise simulation on external world by generative model. And free
energy, the distance of two distributions, drives the system to learning and acting, i.e., change
the distributions of internal model or environment. In this sense, researchers are increasingly
aware of that free energy accounts for the psychoanalytic concept drives (Sikora, 2022). At the
mind level, free energy is perceived as the feeling of unpleasure and anxiety (Albarracin et al.,
2024; Solms, 2019), and hence a reverse occurred. The internal model which constitutes the
subject becomes unconscious, and only free energy, the failure of predictions, are detected.
The first principle of Descartes’ philosophy, “I think, there I am”, is rewritten by Lacan as “I
think where I am not, therefore I am where I do not think” (Lacan, 2001), revealing a totally
consistent meaning. The failure of representation is felt as lack or remainder, arouses drive to
solve this lack, and the orientation of this drive is object petit a. As claimed by Lacan, object
petit a is completely unavailable due to the fundamental split between psychic reality and
physical reality. Consequently, subject can only find alternatives of it, i.e., object of desire,
again and again, to fill lacks while generating lacks at the same time. From the FEP, this
situation can be described as the impossibility of complete fitting between distributions of
internal model and the world, which returns to the basic Kantian hypothesis of FEP – the
precise state of environment is always concealed.
With these basic parallels between two theories, we believe that a formalized Lacanian
psychoanalysis through FEP could efficiently simulates dynamics of subjectivity in depth.
Although Lacan’s theory is more complicated than that we introduced by now, our grasps of
the essence make the rest part as engineering questions.
Computational Lacanian psychoanalysis: one, two, three, and more
Equipped with the intuitive understanding of two theories and their similarities, this
section aims to propose a mechanistic model for the aforementioned minimal definition of
subject – composite status of three orders which is perturbated by desire running over the
logical time. Firstly, we propose a brain-wide model of individual subject that consists of
three orders. Then the interactive dynamics of two such models are explored to mimic the
‘desire running’ between subjects. Finally, we expand the context into multi-agent scenario,
investigating how collective dynamics of subjects contribute to the culture (or the Lacanian
term, the Other) and constrains individual’s behaviors. Through the computational modeling
and simulation, we demonstrate the potential of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis to
mimicking psychic dynamics and interpreting digital twin mind at the macro level. Original
code is available in GitHub (https://github.com/YabYum/ActiveInferenceLacan).
One: subject as a Borromean knot
First of all, we begin with an initial endeavor to dynamically map the functions of the three
orders onto the brain (Figure 2. a), setting the stage for our formal model. Our intention is not
to achieve a precise anatomical or functional mapping, but rather to establish an intuitive
framework for defining the system of current interest. The Real is situated within the upper
brainstem and diencephalic system, as these areas play a fundamental role in affective
experiences, consciousness, and the primary needs of the body such as sustenance, sexuality,
and homeostasis (Dall’Aglio, 2019). The Imaginary corresponds to the parietal and occipital
lobes, given their involvement in motor control, visual perception, and the representation of
self (body-image). The Symbolic domain is allocated to the prefrontal and parietal lobes,
responsible for executing language processing, generating meaning, and conducting thought
experiments (Dall’Aglio, 2019; Miyamoto et al., 2023). Numerous studies have leveraged FEP
to model various cognitive functions across the brain, as summarized in table 1. A hierarchical
model that encompasses these detailed elements corresponding to three orders can fulfill a
more refined digital twin, but we will simplify this model and focus on an intuitive
interpretation at the top-tier hierarchy initially. Also, we assume that three orders are
ontologically equal entities that share FEP as the first principle.

Every order is assigned with an isomorphic generative model (Figure 2. b). Zooming into the
basic unit (Figure 2. c), at time step τ, the unit has a prior belief on current state 𝑃(𝑠) and
predicts potential observations based on likelihood 𝑃(𝑜|𝑠). After receiving real observation,
the approximate posterior of hidden state is updated as:
𝑄(𝑠)=ln𝑃(𝑜|𝑠)+ln𝑃(𝑠)
Variational free energy is as follows:
𝐹[𝑄,𝑜]=𝐷 [𝑄(𝑠)|𝑃(𝑠)]−𝔼 [ln𝑃(𝑜|𝑠)]
𝐾𝐿 𝑄(𝑠)
The first term on right hand side is the KL divergence between current posteriors and priors,
and the second term is negative log of predictions, i.e., model evidence. To reduce variational
free energy or realize prefer states C with actions, transition probability is necessary that
evaluate the result of specific policy 𝜋— potential state caused by this action 𝑄(𝑠̃|𝜋).
Corresponding potential observations is predicted via likelihood 𝑃(𝑜̃|𝑠̃). Then the expected
free energy of candidate policies is calculated:
𝐺(𝜋)= 𝔼 [𝐻[𝑃(𝑜̃|𝑠̃)]]+𝐷 [𝑄(𝑠̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑠̃|𝐶)]
𝑄(𝑠̃|𝜋) 𝐾𝐿
The policy with minimal expected free energy is believed to induce minimal variational free
energy when taken.
Message passing and belief updating processes are applied to connect three function units
(Champion et al., 2021). Variational message passing is traditionally utilized for hierarchical
generative models that implement high-order representation from low-order representations,
for example, connectivity pattern of six-layers neocortex. However, we assume a connectivity
between different cognitive modalities, which is recurrent rather than hierarchical. To be
specific, variational free energy emerging from each order propagates globally to other units
and hence connects three units together with variable weights (Figure 2. b). Intuitively, errors
in one cognition can influence performances of another one. For instance, chronic social
stressors like unemployment cause abnormal physiological activities (Jandackova et al., 2012).
Lacan describes three intertwined orders as a Borromean knot, and the object petit a is the
node that connects them, and the connectivity represents dynamics of drive among three
orders. Additionally from neuroscientific lens, dopamine could generally encodes prediction
errors and transmits across brain (Gardner et al., 2018), ensuring the biological plausibility of
such a connectivity pattern.

closer look at basic unit within the generative model. (d) Simulation of dynamics of three orders when the
Symbolic order is perturbated.
Through this recurrent model, an integrative psyche could be modelled, involving multiple
interconnected cognitive components. For example, we can reproduce the dynamics of
depressed mood by manually inducing free energy in the Symbolic order, which represents
life events against expectations. Therefore, we simulate the 15-timesteps dynamics of the
three orders when the Symbolic order is perturbed, utilizing Python 3.10 (Heins et al., 2022).
We set the initial state (i.e., priors) of the Symbolic order at 0, with a preference value of 4,
while maintaining consistent priors and preferences for the other two orders. As depicted in
Figure 2.d, when the Symbolic order aligns with its preferred position, the other two orders
exhibit synchronous fluctuations, representing the interconnectivity between three orders.
This interconnectivity stems from the brain-wide propagation of divergence item and
residual free energy. The simulated dynamics can be interpreted as that variational free
energy raising from life events against expectations, is propagated to other two domains and
hence disturbs their stable states, inducing various psychopathological symptoms like
emotional responses, autonomic nerves dysfunction, disturbed body perception, and so on.
For a Lacanian interpretation, malfunction within the Symbolic order, leading to lacks in the
Other, causing the return to object petit a. At the same time, his lack disrupts the typical
mediatory function of the Symbolic, preventing the subject from adequately symbolizing
experiences rooted in the Real, therefore induces significant distress in the Imaginary order
(Hook & Vanheule, 2022).
Two: desire as partial generalized synchronization
In this section, we aim to integrate the concept of desire into our model to capture the
dynamics of the psyche within interpersonal contexts. In the field of FEP, interpersonal
dynamics, communications, are studied with the paradigm involving two subjects with
similar internal models (Friston & Frith, 2015; Pan et al., 2023; Vasil et al., 2020). To realize an
effective communication, two agents need to infer each other's state and predict behaviors
based on their models that hence reach a synchronization – referred to as synchronization of
chaos or generalized synchronization.
Lacan frames the essence of desire as metaphor, in a linguistic fashion. That is, envisioning two
subjects as signifiers within a signifying chain, desire of subject is to seizure the signified of
an object (Fink, 2017). From the lens of complexity theory, the desire of one subject on other
manifests as a tendency toward a generalized synchronization of their Symbolic orders. Since
that our model consists of three orders, the process of desire, synchronization of the Symbolic
orders, entails partial generalized synchronization (Figure 3. a). This partial synchronization
enables that two synchronized subjects maintain their respective chaotic behaviors (Hasler et
al., 1998). However, it is worth noting that the direct synchronization of the Symbolic order is
impossible because of the barriers of language as Lacan argued in his L-scheme, and thus the
partial synchronization here is fantasies of subjects (Lacan, 1988).
Figure 3. Desire as partial generalized synchronization between individuals. (a) Two agents, with the same
internal model but different initial states, infer each other’s hidden state of the Symbolic orders as their own
preferences, which guarantee a partial generalize synchronization. When simulating such dynamics, we found
that under identical condition, subsequent dynamics could be highly variable, and we display two of them, as
illustrated in (b) and (c).
To illustrate such a partial generalized synchronization, we utilize the recurrent model
proposed in last section, and employ two subjects (A & B) with shared FEP-RSI internal
model but differing initial states. Subjects A and B keep inferring the state of each other's
Symbolic order, and treating each other’s states as their own preferences. The dynamics of
these two subjects' partial synchronization are illustrated in Figure 3. b and c, spanning 15-
timesteps. As the Figure 3. b shows, stemming from the interconnective nature of three orders,
an ideal partial synchronization of their Symbolic orders can indirectly lead to the
convergence of the other two orders. The perfect unification of two subjects reveals ultimate
goal of desire – a complete fulfillment of object petit a where we find Lacan’s formula of
desire:
$⬦a
which means desire is the relationship between (barred) subject and object petit a. The perfect
synchronization can only exist before one’s birth, and once born, subject is plunged into a
world of others. The first attempt of synchronization with mOther demonstrates the Oedipus
complex of which solution is to enter the Symbolic order through internalizing the language.
As the psychic structure increasingly complex, a sense of total convergence and unity,
minimization of object petit a, like in the uterus, becomes more and more impossible (Ormrod,
2014). Despite the minimal complexity of our model, the subsequent dynamics exhibit
significant diversity under identical initial condition. In Figure 3. b, the two subjects achieve
rapid synchronization, whereas in Figure 3. c, the synchronization remains partial. This
further reflects the multifaceted and random nature of human interaction and communication.
Another interesting observation is the indirect convergence through partial generalized
synchronization, this dynamic aligns with studies indicating that romantic partners often
exhibit shared autonomic physiology and emotional regulation across various timeframes
(Butler & Randall, 2013; Ogolsky et al., 2022; Palumbo et al., 2017). One plausible
interpretation is that the internal models of romantic partners tend to align over time due to
the effects of long-term synchronization. In summary, by unveiling desire as a mechanism
driving partial synchronization between individuals, we formalized the mechanisms of desire
running, successfully expanding the FEP-RSI model from single subject to interpersonal
situations.
Three and more: the Other as collective dynamics
Involving multiple agents into the current context, FEP has been applied into collective
behaviors and cumulative culture (Kastel & Hesp, 2021; Kastel et al., 2023b). With each
participant acting on the principle of minimizing free energy, diverse collective dynamics
could emerge spontaneously without explicitly setting any rule (Heins et al., 2023).
Remarkably, participants in the self-organized system percept the environment, infer their
position, and subsequently become functionally segregated. As articulated by researchers,
these participants “infer what specific functional role they play based on the early inputs they
receive” (Ramstead et al., 2021). This idea naturally leads us to the big Other (or the Other
with a capital O) in the Lacanian psychoanalysis, which manifests as culture, language,
society, ideology, and collective dynamics (Evans, 2006).
Before discussing the vast concept, we can firstly examine the dynamics of a minimal group.
We design a partial generalized synchronization process similar to that in last section but
involving three subjects with shared FEP-RSI model. The synchronizing goal is a triangle – A
desires B, B desires C, and C desires A, as the Figure 4. a depicted. The simulation in Figure 4.
b displays the trio, featuring rich divergences and convergences. Interestingly, by desiring B
who desires C, A could sometimes indirectly synchronize with C, and vice versa. It may be
the clearest illustration of Lacan’s famous assertion “desire is the desire of others’ desire”
(Lacan, 2001). And expanding the trio to collective dynamics composed by the whole society,
man’s desire naturally becomes “the desire of the Other”.
Figure 4. Collective dynamics of a minimal group as partial generalized synchronization between three
individuals. (a) Three agents, with the same internal model but different initial states, implement partial
generalize synchronization of their Symbolic orders in a triangle structure. (b) simulations of such collective
dynamics.
The Other is primarily considered as a “locus in which speech is constituted”, and Lacan
frames this locus as the place of language, laws, norms, culture, and the Symbolic order itself
(Lacan et al., 1993). Now we could understand the Other in the context of FEP. Firstly, all of
the above Symbolic structures emerge from collective behaviors of human society, it is a
collective structure that is contributed, acknowledged, and followed by most of the members.
In terms of language, the Other is the ‘treasure of signifiers’, and as for norms, the Other is a
mundane life routine for everyone. Imagining the Other as an average person, a compression
of collective dynamics, and an agent B in Figure 4. a, many complex interpretations of Lacan
turn obvious. For example, the desire to specific person (agent C) is the desire to the Other
(agent B) by nature. And internalization of the Other, or entering the Symbolic order, is
actually letting agent B occupy some parts of agent A, therefore, is a radical alienation (Lacan,
1988).
This part progressively explores the multi-layered manifestations of psychological dynamics
through the construction and simulation of computational models based computational
Lacanian psychoanalysis. It examines the tripartite structure of an individual subject, the
dynamics of desire and partial synchronization between two subjects, and extends to the
collective behaviors of multiple subjects involving the concept of the Other. With more fined
engineering, we expect a digital twin mind that reproduces one’s cognitive pattern,
interpersonal relations, and social milieu from the first principle.
Concluding remarks
In this paper, we have proposed computational Lacanian psychoanalysis for engineering
digital twin mind. We seek to bridge cognitive computational neuroscience, psychoanalysis,
and digital twin by employing free energy principle (FEP) as a unifying framework. By
elucidating fundamental parallels between FEP and Lacanian psychoanalysis, we have
introduced a novel conceptual model: the FEP-RSI model.
Our exploration began with individual cognitive modalities, which we aligned with specific
brain regions and functions through an intuitive mapping. By constructing a recurrent
generative model, we demonstrated how disturbances in one cognitive domain could
propagate through the system, illustrating the interconnectivity and dynamic nature of
mental processes. Moving from individual to interpersonal dynamics, we incorporated the
concept of desire into our model, presenting it as a drive towards partial generalized
synchronization within and between subjects. This approach allowed us to capture the
nuanced interpersonal dynamics posited by Lacan, showing how desire and the symbolic
interactions of individuals could lead to complex behavioral manifestations. Finally, we
extended our model to consider collective dynamics, bringing multiple agents into a shared
world. This extension aimed to simulate how individual desires and interactions contribute to
the emergent properties of social groups and cultural constructs. The computational Lacanian
psychoanalysis formalizes various Lacanian core concept, including logical time, lack, object
petit a, desire, and the Other. And simulations reproduce Lacanian descriptive dynamics of
psyche, helping us understand this extremely complex theory at the same time.
By leveraging computational tools and the robust theoretical foundation provided by FEP, we
suggest a potential approach for future research that could further refine our understanding
of mental processes. This integrated approach opens new avenues for the development of
sophisticated digital twins of the human mind, capable of simulating individual and
collective psychological dynamics. Further efforts will focus on a hierarchical and recurrent
model that contains various cognitive modalities, aiming to refine the precision and
granularity with which these modalities interact and influence one another. By constructing
such ‘cognition-omics’, we envision developing a more robust and detailed digital twin that
not only mimics the cognitive processes of an individual but also dynamically adapts to the
changing psychological states and environmental inputs. And larger networks of multiple
digital twins could provide valuable insights into social dynamics, cultural evolution, and the
formation of collective beliefs and behaviors.

=== REVISE TO ===
PROFESSIONAL TONE: Begin directly with content - NO conversational openings like 'Okay, here's...'

1. Fix all issues above
2. Title: "Return to Lacan: an approach to digital twin mind with free energy principle"
3. Include 10-15 quotes from paper text
   - Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
   - Use consistent quote formatting: 'The authors state: "quote"' or vary attribution phrases
   - Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition
   - CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
4. ELIMINATE ALL REPETITION - each sentence must be unique
   - Check before each sentence: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary attribution phrases - do NOT repeat 'The authors state' multiple times
5. Extract methodology, results with numbers, key quotes
6. 1000-1500 words, structured with ### headers
