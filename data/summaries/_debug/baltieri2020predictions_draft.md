Recently, active inference an active inference formulation of the Watt governor, ahas been proposed as part of a new and unifying framework system often portrayed as the “anti-representational”in the cognitive sciences: predictiveprocessing.

Under simplifying assumptions, the equationsare linearised near equilibrium.The Watt (flyballorcentrifugal)steam governor was used byVan Gelder (1995,1998) as a paradigmatic system tochallenge the dominant cognitivist understanding ofcognition. Van Gelder (1995,1998) claimed thatdynamicalsystemstheoryprovidedabetterlanguagetoexplaintheinnerworkingsofcognitiveagents,similarlytowhat engineers have done with the Watt governor in termsof attractors, stability analysis, etc.. At the same time, hethen questioned whether computational descriptions of thegovernor offered any explanatory power – over – the use ofdynamical systems theory. While many proponents of thedynamicist view see the computational metaphor assurplusinmanycases(Chemero,2009),orintimatelytiedtodeeplyflawedphilosophyofmind(Dreyfus,1972),othersseecomputationalandinformation-theoreticdescriptionsof asystem as useful epistemic tools offering interpretationsthat are complementary to a dynamical systems analysis(Bechtel,1998;BeerandWilliams,2015).Inbothcases,thenatureofthetightcouplingbetweenaflyballgovernoranditssteamengineisaccepted,andtheresultingmodeofcognition departs from the cognitivist one, i.e., agovernor does not “read” the speed of the engine to“compute”, offline, the next best action.
