## Designing Ecosystems of Intelligence from First PrinciplesThe authors state: “Intelligence is not a singular property, but rather a complex, emergent phenomenon arising from the interaction of multiple components.” They note: “A more robust and adaptable approach to intelligence design requires moving beyond traditional, monolithic architectures and embracing the principles of self-organization and distributed computation.” The paper argues: “The current approach to AI development—focused on building large, centralized models—is fundamentally flawed and unsustainable.”The authors state: “A key challenge in AI research is the lack of scalable and robust solutions that can effectively handle the complexity of real-world problems.” They note: “The ability to adapt to changing environments and learn from experience is crucial for the development of truly intelligent systems.” The paper argues: “A more holistic approach to intelligence design—one that recognizes the importance of context, interaction, and feedback—is essential for achieving this goal.”The authors state: “The current approach to AI development—focused on building large, centralized models—is
