### OverviewThis paper investigates the development of a dynamic cognitive map for autonomous navigation, drawing inspiration from animal navigation strategies. The authors propose a novel computational model that integrates active inference to replicate human navigational abilities by incorporating a dynamically expanding cognitive map over predicted poses within an Active Inference framework, enhancing its generative model plasticity to novel environments. Comparative analyses in mini-grid environments with the Clone-Structured Cognitive Graph (CSCG) model highlight the model’s ability to rapidly learn environmental structures within a single episode, with minimal navigation overlap.### MethodologyThe authors’ approach centers around a dynamically expanding cognitive map, integrating active inference to model the agent’s internal state and predict future states. The model utilizes a generative model, incorporating observations and positions through transitions, as illustrated in Figure1b), showing the processed observation of the agent and c) presenting the resulting cognitive graph. The model’s state inference process is based on Bayesian inference, predicting future states and positions, growing its cognitive map by forming prior beliefs about un-visited locations. The model’s parameters are updated based on the transition probabilities, as shown in Equation1, and the model’s learning rate is adjusted based on the situation. The model’s key components include the Markov matrices A (observation likelihood), B (state transition), and A (position likelihood). The model’s learning rate is adjusted based on the situation. The model’s parameters are updated based on the transition probabilities, as shown in Equation1, and the model’s learning rate is adjusted based on the situation.
