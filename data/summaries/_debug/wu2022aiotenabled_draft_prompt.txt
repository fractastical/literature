4) ActivityInferenceusingRandomForest: MachineLearn-
ing (ML) could generate a learning-based intelligent model
that learns from the labelled training dataset output by the
previous steps to determine the activity type, which gener-
ally has better overall performance compared with rule-based
methods [10]. Among various learning-based ML models,
we chose Random Forest (RF) [11] because of its high
accuracy, flexibility (suitable for different data distributions),
interpretability, and low running time complexitiy. RF is
made up of a couple of decision trees (DTs) [12] as the basic
predictors.DTisaheuristicMLtechniquethatrecursivelyand
greedily assesses the features of the input data. Specifically,
a decision tree splits its branch by testing for one of the
input data’s properties. And every step conducts testing based
on the divisions established in the preceding steps. Within a

• A decision tree generally contains a root node, a number of internal nodes, and leaf nodes. Each leaf node
corresponds to a class determined. And each internal node corresponds to testing on one attribute.
