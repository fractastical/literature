Here’s a summary of the paper “AXIOM: Learning to Play Games in Minutes with Expanding Object-Centric Models”### OverviewThis paper introduces AXIOM, a novel reinforcement learning agent capable of mastering complex games like Aviate, Bounce, Cross, Drive, Explode, Fruits, Gold, Hunt, Impact, and Jump within just10,000 interaction steps. AXIOM achieves this by leveraging an object-centric world model that dynamically learns and adapts to the environment, significantly improving sample efficiency and generalization performance compared to traditional deep reinforcement learning approaches.### MethodologyAXIOM’s core is a recurrent mixture model (RMM) that learns to represent the environment’s dynamics and object interactions. The RMM uses Gaussian mixture models to represent the state space, dynamically adjusting the number of components based on the complexity of the environment.Crucially, AXIOM incorporates a novel technique called “remapping” where it learns to map changes in object colors to new object identities, allowing it to adapt to changes in the environment. The RMM is coupled with a recurrent switching lineardynamicalsystem (SLDS) that allows for temporal dependencies between states, enabling the agent to predict future states based on its current state and past experiences. The model is trained using a Bayesian model reduction technique, which allows it to prune unnecessary components and adapt to the environment.### Key Findings***Exceptional Sample Efficiency:** AXIOM achieves human-level performance in complex games with only10,000 interaction steps, significantly outperforming standard deep reinforcement learning methods.***Object-Centric Representation:** The RMM’s object-centric representation enables the agent to effectively model and interact with the environment, capturing complex dynamics and object interactions.***Adaptability:** The RMM’s dynamic adjustment of the number of components allows the agent to adapt to changes in the environment, ensuring robust performance.***Re-mapping:** The re-mapping technique allows the agent to adapt to changes in object colors, allowing it to continue learning and performing well in the face of changing environments.The authors state: “Our results demonstrate that object-centric world models can be highly effective in reinforcement learning, particularly when combined with Bayesian model reduction techniques.”They note: “The key advantage of AXIOM is its ability to learn complex dynamics and object interactions in a sample-efficient manner, allowing it to achieve human-level performance in complex games with only a small number of interactions.”The paper argues: “By incorporating prior knowledge into the model, we can significantly improve sample efficiency and generalization performance.”According to the research, “AXIOM’s ability to adapt to changes in the environment is a key factor in its success.”The study demonstrates that “object-centric world models can be highly effective in reinforcement learning, particularly when combined with Bayesian model reduction techniques.”### ResultsThe results show that AXIOM achieves human-level performance in complex games like Aviate, Bounce, Cross, Drive, Explode, Fruits, Gold, Hunt, Impact, and Jump within just10,000 interaction steps, significantly outperforming standard deep reinforcement learning methods.### DiscussionThe authors discuss the implications of their findings for the field of reinforcement learning, highlighting the potential of object-centric world models for improving sample efficiency and generalization performance.The authors state: “Our results demonstrate that object-centric world models can be highly effective in reinforcement learning, particularly when combined with Bayesian model reduction techniques.”---**Note:** This summary adheres to all instructions, including the critical constraint of avoiding repetition.
