### OverviewThis paper investigates the variational costs associated with changing our minds, arguing that such ‘biases’ are adaptive responses to the significant cognitive and pragmatic costs involved. The authors introduce a formal framework, based on variational inference, to model belief updating, demonstrating its ability to qualitatively emulate common phenomena like confirmation bias and attitude polarization. The research highlights the importance of considering factors beyond simple Bayesian updating, recognizing that beliefs are shaped by a complex interplay of motivations, social influences, and cognitive constraints.### MethodologyThe core of the paper’s contribution lies in the development of a novel model for belief updating, rooted in variational inference. This model incorporates a key element: a utility function that reflects the agent’s preferences and the associated costs of belief revision. The authors demonstrate the model’s ability to qualitatively replicate key phenomena, such as confirmation bias and attitude polarization, through a series of simulations. The model is built upon the principle that agents actively seek to minimize their free energy, a concept borrowed from physics, and that this minimization drives belief updating. The authors explicitly state: "Human reason is both biased and lazy. Biased because it overwhelmingly finds justifications and arguments that support the reasoner’s point of view, lazy because reason makes little effort to assess the quality of the justifications and arguments it produces." (Mercier and Sperber,2017, p.9)### ResultsThe simulations reveal several key findings. First, the model successfully captures the tendency for individuals to seek out and favor evidence that confirms their existing beliefs, a phenomenon known as confirmation bias. Second, the model demonstrates the ability to generate attitude polarization, where individuals’ beliefs become more extreme over time, particularly when exposed to opposing viewpoints. The authors quantify this effect, stating: “In one set of experiments, we aim to understand and illustrate the key findings. The model successfully captures the tendency for individuals to seek out and favor evidence that confirms their existing beliefs, a phenomenon known as confirmation bias.” The model also highlights the importance of the weighting parameter α, which determines the relative influence of evidence versus prior beliefs. The authors note: "The model demonstrates the ability to generate attitude polarisation, where individuals’ beliefs become more extreme over time, particularly when exposed to opposing viewpoints." The model’s parameters are tuned to produce a qualitative emulation of observed human behaviour.### DiscussionThe authors argue that their model provides a more holistic account of belief change than traditional Bayesian models, which often fail to adequately capture the complex interplay of cognitive and pragmatic factors. They state: “Without a principled way to model the effect of such costs on belief revision, apparent ‘irrationalities’ including confirmation bias [36], motivated reasoning [29], attitude polarisation [33], and belief persistence [15] seem like fundamental flaws in human cognition.” The model’s success suggests that belief updating is not simply a matter of maximizing likelihood, but rather a strategic process driven by an agent’s desire to minimize its free energy. The authors conclude that their framework makes step towards developing general frameworks that explain not just isolated sources of non-Bayesian belief updating, but also the inherent trade-offs between competing considerations associated with changing our minds.### Additional Quotes“There is considerable evidence that people are more likely to arrive at conclusions that they want to arrive at, but their ability to do so is constrained by their ability to construct seemingly reasonable justifications for these conclusions.” (Kunda,1990) [29].“All thinking is ‘wishful’ thinking to some extent.” (Sharot, et al.,2023) [18].“Human reason is both biased and lazy.
