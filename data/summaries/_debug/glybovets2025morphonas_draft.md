### MorphoNAS: Embryogenic Neural Architecture Search Through Morphogen-Guided Development – Summary### OverviewThis paper introduces MorphoNAS, a novel system for generating neural architectures through an embryogenic developmental process. The system leverages morphogen-guided development, mimicking biological neural network formation, to create complex networks from simple rules. MorphoNAS combines the Free Energy Principle, reaction-diffusion systems, and gene regulatory networks to achieve self-organization and architectural generation. The system’s core is a compact genome encoding morphogen dynamics and threshold-based rules, allowing for the emergence of neural networks without explicit architectural design. The paper demonstrates the system’s ability to generate networks with specified structural properties and functional capabilities, highlighting its potential as a generative framework for automated neural architecture search.### MethodologyThe MorphoNAS system operates based on a set of core principles, as described by the authors. The system’s development is driven by the Free Energy Principle, which posits that all living systems minimize their surprise or uncertainty about their environment. The system utilizes reaction-diffusion systems, inspired by Turing patterns, to generate spatial patterns of morphogens, which then guide the development of neural networks. Gene regulatory networks are also incorporated to control the expression of genes involved in neural network development. The system’s genome encodes the morphogen dynamics, including secretion rates and diffusion properties, as well as threshold-based rules for cell fate decisions. The system employs a discrete time step approach, iteratively updating the morphogen concentrations and cell states until a stable neural network architecture emerges. The system’s evolutionary experiments were conducted on two different domains: structural targeting, where the system was tasked with generating networks with predefined graph configurations, and functional performance on the CartPole control task, where the system was evaluated based on its ability to achieve low complexity solutions. The system’s parameters were set to ensure that the system could generate networks with31 nodes and87 connections, and the system was evaluated based on its ability to achieve low complexity solutions when target network size minimization was applied.### ResultsThe experiments demonstrated the system’s ability to generate neural networks with specified structural properties. In the structural targeting domain, the system was able to generate networks with31 nodes and87 connections in100% of cases. In the functional performance domain, the system achieved low complexity solutions when target network size minimization was applied. The system was able to generate a functional network with10 neurons and30 connections when the target network size was minimized. The system’s performance was evaluated based on its ability to achieve low complexity solutions when target network size minimization was applied. The system was able to generate a functional network with6-7 neurons and30 connections when target network size minimization was applied. The system’s final state, as shown in Figure5, demonstrates a complex network topology with31 nodes and87 connections, highlighting the system’s ability to self-organize into a functional neural network.
