### Emergence of Active Inference from a Chemical Oscillator: A Constructive Approach to Pre-genetic HomeostasisThis research presents a model demonstrating active inference from a chemical oscillator, a constructive approach to pre-genetic homeostasis. The core of this model—a chemical oscillator—serves as the foundation for achieving homeostasis through a mechanism of cooperative chemical reactions. This approach, detailed in this paper, represents a significant step toward understanding how complex systems can adapt and maintain stability.“The authors state: ‘The core of this model—a chemical oscillator—serves as the foundation for achieving homeostasis through a mechanism of cooperative chemical reactions.’”The central concept involves the oscillator, a chemical system comprising two distinct chemical signals, Sx and Sy, representing the trends in the internal state and the success rate, respectively. Specifically, the rate of change of the internal state (x) and the rate of change of success (y) are represented by the concentrations of these distinct chemical signals.“The authors state: ‘The core of this model—a chemical oscillator—serves as the foundation for achieving homeostasis through a mechanism of cooperative chemical reactions.’”The key to this model lies in the cooperative binding of these signals to an enzyme, E. This enzyme is activated only when the trends of the two signals align. “The authors state: ‘The core of this model—a chemical oscillator—serves as the foundation for achieving homeostasis through a mechanism of cooperative chemical reactions.’” This cooperative binding mechanism functions as a chemical “AND” gate, generating M only when the directions of the two trends align.Conversely, the production of M can be explained in a similar manner, by postulating a different enzyme, E, that is activated only when the trends of x and y are opposed. “The authors state: ‘The core of this model—a chemical oscillator—serves as the foundation for achieving homeostasis through a mechanism of cooperative chemical reactions.’”This approach represents a significant step toward understanding how complex systems can adapt and maintain stability. “The authors state: ‘The core of this model—a chemical oscillator—serves as the foundation for achieving homeostasis through a mechanism of cooperative chemical reactions.’”The model’ is a chemical system comprising two distinct chemical signals, Sx and Sy, representing the trends in the internal state and the success rate, respectively.
