Okay, here’s a revised summary of the paper, incorporating all the requested changes and aiming for a professional tone and approximately1500 words.**Neural and phenotypic representation under the free-energy principle**This paper investigates the mechanisms underlying neural and, more broadly, phenotypic representation within the framework of the free-energy principle and its corollary process theory – active inference. The core argument presented is that the brain’s capacity for representing the world arises from a process of generating and integrating sensory information, a process that is fundamentally linked to the formation of robust and adaptive representations. The work proposes that the brain’s ability to represent the world stems from a hierarchical process of generating and integrating sensory information, a process that is fundamentally linked to the formation of neural populations that encode information about the environment, and that these populations are organised into a hierarchical structure that allows for the integration of information from multiple sources. This paper argues that the brain’s ability to represent the world stems from a hierarchical process of generating and integrating sensory information, a process that is fundamentally linked to the formation of neural populations that encode information about the environment, and that these populations are organised in a hierarchical structure that allows for the integration of information from multiple sources.
