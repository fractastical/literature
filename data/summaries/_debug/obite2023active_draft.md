INTRODUCTIONThe present and emerging wireless technologies, such as6G, are expected to experience an increase in data intensity.There is a growing expectation to connect a larger number ofself-autonomousdevicesandInternetofThings(IoT)devices,putting pressure on the existing wireless network [1]. Toaddress these demands, future wireless systems need toincorporate innovative technologies like unmanned aerialvehicles (UAVs), cognitive radio (CR), and non-orthogonalmultiple access (NOMA). The integration of thesetechnologies requires intelligent resource allocation toimprove system performance. UAVs have gained significantattention in wireless communications due to theiradvantageous line-of-sight (LoS) communication,cost-effectiveness, miniaturization, and flexibility [2].CR serves as the main technology that enables secondaryusers (SUs) to utilize licensed spectrum when availablewithout causing interference to primary users (PUs) [3].Conversely, NOMA has demonstrated superior spectrumefficiency, user fairness, and the ability to accommodatemultiple users simultaneously in the same sub-channel byemploying superposition coding (SC) at the transmitter andsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver [4].However, in order to fully harness the promised benefits ofNOMA, a key challenge lies in jointly optimizing discretesubchannels and continuous power to maximize the sumrate in such a dynamic system. Additionally, it has beenestablished that the problem of maximizing the sum rate inwireless networks is strongly NP-hard [5]. Hence, numeroussuboptimal or heuristic approaches have been proposed byresearchers. The authors in [6] explore heuristic and iterativesearch optimization methods for user pairing and resourceallocation in the uplink NOMA scenario. In [7], the authorsinvestigate the stochastic successive convex approximationmethod to maximize the sum rate of users under imperfecterrors in each episode. An upper bound is derived for theoptimal weighted sum rate, and the authors propose a near-optimal approach using Lagrangian duality and dynamicprogramming. For a comprehensive review of conventionaloptimization approaches, we refer the readers to [9]. It isimportant to note that these traditional optimization schemeslack adaptive online self-awareness and often involvecomplex mathematical formulations, making themimpractical for real-time systems that require minimallatency.In recent years, machine learning techniques havedemonstrated significant potential in addressing complexcomputational tasks and have been widely implemented invarious wireless communication systems [10]. However, deeplearning methods require well-labeled datasets for training inorder to achieve accurate results. Obtaining such datasets canbe challenging in complex wireless networks, and the resultingmodels may be difficult to interpret [11]. Likewise, in [9],deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) is employed tomaximize the sum rate, power allocation, and channelassignment in a multi-carrier NOMA scheme. Nevertheless,despite the recent successes of RL, several limitations hinderits full implementation in dynamic systems [12]. Firstly, RLalgorithms often require numerous iterations to converge toan optimal solution due to the strong influence of negativerewards [13],[14]. An RL agent must take severalactions to learn how to improve its policy. Additionally, RLagents are typically trained for specific predefined tasks, whichlimits their ability to generalize to new experiences [15]. Analternative approach widely studied and rooted inneurocognitive science, called active inference, provides afundamental framework for characterizing adaptive behaviorsin unknown and complex environments [13],[16]. In thisframework, every agent (considered a self-organizing system)maintains a dynamic equilibrium with its external environmentto minimize prediction errors [17]. Preliminary results suggestthat active inference is more adaptable and resilient in a varietyof settings that are challenging for RL models [18].We also observe that the majority of active inference agents aretrained to learn generative models with predefined sections of thestate space [13],[19]. While this approach is suitable for discretestate spaces, it becomes impractical for complex dynamic systems[20]. In this paper, we explore active inference using a uniquegeneralized dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN) to learnthe complex, time-changing network environment.=== END OF PAPER TEXT ===
