armed bandits (CMABs) called observation-augmented CMABs He wanted to observe hydrate
(OA-CMABs) wherein a robot uses extra outcome observations

faulty observations and non-Gaussian distributions. Results for

I. INTRODUCTION
IN uncertain remote environments, such as deep space
and underwater, there are many situations in which an
autonomousrobotmustchoosethebestoptionamongmultiple
alternatives to accomplish a task. Such decisions are chal-
lenging since the world is stochastic, and the distributions of
outcomes resulting from options often are unknown a priori.
One efficient way to reason about the parameters of outcome
distributionswouldbetoutilizeextraobservationsfromexter-
nal information sources, e.g. humans and object detectors [1].
Yet, if these extra observations are noisy and a robot naively
uses them to infer parameters, then such observations can do

any particular generative functions. Thus, once more suitable

C. Results
1) Effectiveness of extra outcome observations from exter-
nal information sources: In the first set of simulation experi-
ments, we determine appropriate option selection approaches
forOA-CMABsassumingnoerroneousexternalobservations.
In the most difficult case (more options and features but less
contexts), the total number of search site K is 15, the length
ofcontextvectorsC is3,andthenumberofsciencecategories
F is 12 (e.g. ‘Ice’, ‘Hydrated salt’, ‘Sulfate’, and ‘Hydrated
sulfuric acid’). Therefore, the lander is required to estimate
540 hidden parameters in total. Assuming that scientists are
most interested in hydrated sulfuric acid (i.e. it is f ), the
p
prior preference p (o) was set as p (o)=0.01 if o̸=f .

As a result, as can be seen in Fig. 4, for all experiments,

seconds, comporting with our assumptions for the communication intervals.
It is worth noting that if there is prior knowledge indicating that only
specific outcome observations are relevant, agents can limit the calculation
ofEFE(a k ,o)tothoseoutcomes,thusreducingcomputationalcosts.

(k=1 for this instance) much more often. Since the results
were notably good when AIF and TS were used with human
semantic observations (orange and blue plots in Fig. 4), only
these two approaches are used in the rest of the experiments.
Also, hereafter we focus on the case of K =5, C =3, and
F = 4, since compared to the other cases, the alternative
methods considered here become most competitive with AIF.
2) Performance of the PSDA algorithm: Next, to assess
the benefit of the proposed PSDA measurement update al-
gorithm, we conducted simulation experiments with the prior
probabilityofhumansemanticobservationbeingincorrect,i.e.
FP =p(ζ=0), set at 0.2, 0.4, and 0.63. Here we compared
the following data fusion modalities 1) no semantic obser-
vations (w/o human), 2) naively fuse semantic observations
(w/ human, naive), and 3) fuse semantic observations with
PSDA (w/ human, PSDA), for AIF and TS. The threshold

exploitation term, leading to the cluster on the right-hand side
of this figure. Thus, even if one subset of AIF agents quickly
determines the best search site and generates very small
cumulative regrets (magenta lines in Fig. 8), the suboptimal
behavior of the remaining AIF agents (green lines in Fig. 8)
causes average cumulative regrets (orange lines) to gradually
become larger than those of the TS agents. Therefore, the

when the human semantic observations were occasionally
erroneous, by dynamically and probabilistically estimating
association hypothesis probabilities γ, the PSDA estimates
gradually approached to the true hidden parameters (dashed
vertical lines) and the final estimates were better compared to
the ones when incorrect human semantic observations were
naively fused as in Fig. 7 (bottom row). As a consequence,
employing the PSDA measurement update algorithm resulted
in smaller cumulative regrets (Fig. 6). Note that in Fig. 7, the

Such clustering will not always occur, e.g. when humans pro-
