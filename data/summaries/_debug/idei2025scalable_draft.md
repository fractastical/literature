### OverviewThis paper investigates the development of a scalable predictive processing framework for multitask caregiving robots. The authors propose a novel approach based on the free-energy principle, enabling robots to learn and generalize across diverse caregiving tasks, such as repositioning and wiping. The core of the framework is a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network, capable of directly integrating high-dimensional, multimodal sensory inputs without relying on handcrafted feature engineering. The research demonstrates that this framework can self-organize dynamic latent states, capture variability in uncertainty, and infer occluded states, ultimately leading to robust and adaptive behavior under uncertain real-world conditions.### MethodologyThe authors developed a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network (PV-RNN) to address the challenge of multitask learning in caregiving robots. The PV-RNN is grounded in the free-energy principle, aiming to minimize prediction errors between sensory inputs and internally generated predictions. The model consists of three hierarchical levels: an exteroceptive module, a multimodal associative module, and an executive module. The exteroceptive module processes low-level sensory inputs, while the multimodal associative module integrates these inputs to generate mid-level representations. The executive module controls higher-level patterns of visuo-proprioceptive integration. The model was trained using a simulated environment, with a dual-arm humanoid robot (AIREC) equipped with binocular RGB cameras and joint torque sensors. The robot was trained on two caregiving tasks: repositioning and wiping. During training, the robot was teleoperated, allowing for precise control and data collection. The authors used a sliding short-time window (𝐻 =30) to update the model’s latent states, enabling it to adapt to dynamic changes in the environment. The model was trained using a variational free-energy minimization approach, with synaptic weights and adaptive variables updated iteratively to minimize the cumulative free energy. The authors employed a standard backpropagation algorithm to update the model’s parameters. The model was evaluated using a set of test sequences, with five independent trials per sequence, to assess its generalization performance.### ResultsThe PV-RNN demonstrated robust performance across both the repositioning and wiping tasks. The model was able to accurately predict the robot’s actions, even when faced with variations in initial posture, bed height, and motion timing. Specifically, the model exhibited self-organized hierarchical latent dynamics, capturing distinct patterns of activity across the three modules. The exteroceptive module maintained continuous visual representations, particularly highlighting regions corresponding to the robot’s left arm and the mannequin’s face. The multimodal associative module captured dynamic visuo-proprioceptive integration, particularly during the reaching and wiping phases. The executive module exhibited state changes at subtask boundaries, strongly detecting the shifts from initial posture to reaching and from wiping to releasing. The model’s performance was quantified by measuring prediction errors across time steps and latent states. The results showed that the model’s prediction errors were significantly lower than those of a baseline model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the PV-RNN. Furthermore, the model exhibited robust adaptation to different bed heights, demonstrating its ability to handle uncertainty. The model’s ability to infer occluded states was also demonstrated, highlighting its capacity to compensate for incomplete sensory information. The model’s performance was evaluated by measuring the variance of the latent states, which was significantly lower than that of a baseline model, indicating that the model was able to effectively reduce uncertainty. The model’s performance was quantified by measuring the number of successful trials, which was significantly higher than that of a baseline model, demonstrating its ability to generalize across different tasks. The model’s ability to handle uncertainty was also demonstrated by measuring the variance of the latent states, which was significantly lower than that of a baseline model.

The PV-RNN demonstrates that a single computational principle – minimizing prediction errors – can enable robots to learn and generalize across diverse caregiving tasks. The model’s ability to self-organize latent dynamics, capture variability in uncertainty, and infer occluded states suggests that the brain may operate in a similar manner. The model’s asymmetric interference in multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on repositioning, while learning the repositioning task led to a modest reduction in wiping performance, further supports the idea that tasks with different levels of uncertainty are processed differently. The model’s robustness to degraded vision through visuo-proprioceptive integration underscores the importance of multimodal sensory information for adaptive behavior. The authors’ work provides a valuable contribution to the field of robotics and offers a promising approach for developing intelligent caregiving robots.
