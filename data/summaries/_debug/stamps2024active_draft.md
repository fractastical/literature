### Active Inference Demonstrated with Artificial Spin IceThe authors investigate active inference with a three-dimensional Artificial Spin Ice structure, demonstrating that thermal fluctuations can drive this magnetic spin system to evolve under dynamic constraints imposed through interactions with an external environment as predicted by the neurological free energy principle and active inference. The structure is defined by two layers of magnetic nanoelements where one layer is a square Artificial Spin Ice geometry and the other functions as a sensory filter that mediates interaction between the external environment and the “hidden” Artificial Spin Ice layer. Spin dynamics displayed by the bilayer structure are shown to be well described using a continuous form of a neurological free energy principle that has been previously proposed as a high level description of certain biological neural processes. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this proposed bilayer geometry is able to reproduce theoretical results derived previously for examples of active inference in neurological contexts.The authors state: "A numerical model of interacting nanomagnetic elements is used to demonstrate active inference with a three dimensional Artificial Spin Ice structure." They note: "It is shown that thermal fluctuations can drive this magnetic spin system to evolve under dynamic constraints imposed through interactions with an external environment as predicted by the neurological free energy principle and active inference." The paper argues: "The structure is defined by two layers of magnetic nanoelements where one layer is a square Artificial Spin Ice geometry and the other functions as a sensory filter that mediates interaction between the external environment and the ‘hidden’ Artificial Spin Ice layer." The authors further state: "Spin dynamics displayed by the bilayer structure are shown to be well described using a continuous form of a neurological free energy principle that has been previously proposed as a high level description of certain biological neural processes."The authors demonstrate that numerical simulations are able to reproduce theoretical results derived previously for examples of active inference in neurological contexts. They note: "In recent years new insights into how a brain might process and respond to information have emerged from a neurological theory whose primary components are called active inference and the free energy principle." They add: "The theory provides a high-level mathematical description of neural processes where comparisons are made between predictions and sensory perceptions resulting in adjustments that affect future sensory input." The authors explain: "The theory is built from simple general assumptions and has been proposed as a biologically plausible mechanism that can describe key aspects of motor control and movement regulation."The authors describe the model as consisting of two layers of magnetic nanoelements, one of which is a square Artificial Spin Ice geometry and the other functions as a sensory filter. They state: "We take inspiration from the long history of using binary spins in models for neural operations18 and theories for their operation in neural networks (examples are discussed in Ref.19 and references therein)." They add: "Likewise, Ising spin models have been shown to be well suited to correctly predict the overall physics of ASIs because the spin’s binary ‘up’ or ‘down’ describes the nanomagnet’s north-south pole alignment." The authors explain: "In the following, we lay out how our proposed model behaves magnetically, and then map out how that behaviour is a physical implementation of an active inference agent."The authors describe the experimental setup as involving a bilayer with16 spins in a so-called “square” ice geometry. They state: "The top layer is made of well-separated superparamagnetic nanomagnets whose magnetization can flip direction randomly and independently by thermal excitation as superparamagnets. However, also as with superparamagnets, the nanomagnets will try to align their magnetization along the needle axis below a critical temperature without the application of an external magnetic field." They add: "At their simplest, nanomagnets can be considered to behave like compass needles in that they attempt to align their north and south poles according to the direction of magnetic fields (but constrained by the needle geometry)."The authors propose two arrays of nanomagnets in a bilayer configuration arranged in a three dimensional geometry as sketched in figure1a. They state: "This structure is a modification of a geometry suggested in BegumPopyet al.20. The top layer is placed above the vertices of the so-called ‘square’ ASI geometry. The bottom layer is an array of nanomagnets arranged in an ASI geometry whose nanoelements are placed close enough to interact strongly with one another through their stray magnetic fields. They also respond to the stray fields produced by the top layer of superparamagnetic nanomagnets." They add: "We find that when viewed on the time-scale of the environment, the average magnetization produced by the hidden layer follows a trajectory described by the magnetic response that can converge to the neighbourhood of a preset value."The authors state: "The bottom hidden ASI layer of figure1a is made of16 spins in a so-called ‘square’ ice geometry. These ground states are characterized by ‘two-fold degenerate’ ground state where the two lowest energy spin configurations produce a zero average magnetization for the array. These ground states are characterized by ‘ice rules’ that require two spins at each vertex to point inwards towards the vertex centre with the other two spins pointing out from the vertex. The stability of vertex spin configurations depends on temperature as thermal fluctuations have a finite probability to reverse spins randomly."The authors describe the sensory spin layer as having nanomagnets whose magnetization can flip direction randomly and independently by thermal excitation as superparamagnets. They state: "However, also as with superparamagnets, the nanomagnets will try to align their magnetization along the needle axis below a critical temperature without the application of an external magnetic field." They add: "At their simplest, nanomagnets can be considered to behave like compass needles in that they attempt to align their north and south poles according to the direction of magnetic fields (but constrained by the needle geometry)."The authors state: "We use numerical simulations to illustrate the importance of how the sensory spins receive environment position and velocity information and active inference generated by hidden layer spin states drive the system towards a target velocity v =0.6." They note: "The authors state: ‘A free energy principle for the brain’."

Research into ASI was initially directed towards investigations of complex frustrated systems with an emphasis on experiment.10,11 One of the benefits has been to provide experimental systems that can be probed with unprecedented detail on time- and length-scales that are not otherwise amenable to study.12 Some of the most recent developments have expanded the field to include neuromorphic applications for machine learning13–15 and fabrication of non-trivial three dimensional structures in complex geometries.16,17"
