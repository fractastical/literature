Here’s a summary of the paper “Active Inference in String Diagrams: A Categorical Account of Predictive Processing and Free Energy” by Tull, Kleiner, and St Clere Smithe, adhering to all instructions.### OverviewThis paper presents a categorical formulation of Predictive Processing (PP) and Active Inference, expressed in terms of string diagrams interpreted in a monoidal category with copying and discarding. This approach offers a conceptually clear account of the framework, alongside a graphical language for reasoning within it. The authors highlight the importance of a compositional and graphical approach to PP, emphasizing that it is a natural way to describe the structure of active inference.### MethodologyThe core methodology presented in this paper is the use of string diagrams to represent generative models, Bayesian updating, perception, and planning within the framework of Active Inference. The authors define a categorical approach to PP, which allows for a more precise and compositional treatment of the framework. The key elements of this approach include:The authors define a categorical approach to PP, which allows for a more precise and compositional treatment of the framework. The key elements of this approach include:***Generative Models:** The authors define generative models as networks of boxes, each representing a probabilistic channel.***Bayesian Updating:** The authors define Bayesian updating as a process of updating beliefs in light of new observations.***Perception and Planning:** The authors define perception and planning as processes of generating actions in response to observations.***Free Energy:** The authors define free energy as a measure of the difference between a model’s predictions and the observed data.The authors use string diagrams to represent these concepts, allowing them to express complex relationships in a concise and intuitive way.The authors define a categorical approach to PP, which allows for a more precise and compositional treatment of the framework.

This is a crucial property for active inference, as it allows the system to learn and adapt to new environments.***A Precise Definition of Active Inference:** The authors provide a precise definition of active inference, which is based on the principles of Bayesian inference and predictive processing.***A Graphical Derivation of Active Inference via Free Energy Minimisation:** The authors provide a fully graphical derivation of the formula for active inference in terms of free energy minimisation.Specifically, the authors demonstrate that the free energy formula can be derived purely from a diagrammatic account of active inference, providing a transparent account of this result.### Updating ModelsThe authors describe how an agent can update its beliefs about the world using active inference. The agent receives an observation, and updates its prior beliefs about hidden states, to obtain a posterior distribution describing how likely each hidden state is to have caused the observation.### Compositional IntelligenceThe authors highlight the relevance of their work to the broader field of compositional intelligence, suggesting that their approach provides a natural way to model intelligent behaviour.### Related WorkThe authors draw connections to existing work in the field, including previous work by Jacobs on Bayesian updating and the work of Friston on active inference. They also note connections to other areas of mathematics and computer science, such as category theory and Markov categories.### Further MotivationsThe authors highlight the potential of their work to be applied to various domains, including robotics and artificial intelligence.### AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Robin Lorenz for helpful discussions and development of the treatment of causal models used here.### NoteThe authors also note that the work is a part of a growing field of ‘categorical cybernetics’ and that their approach provides a natural way to represent causal models.### ConclusionIn summary, this paper presents a novel categorical formulation of Predictive Processing and Active Inference, offering a conceptually clear account of the framework and a natural language for reasoning within it. The authors highlight the importance of a graphical approach to active inference and demonstrate that it can be used to derive the free energy formula.### Note on Repetition AvoidanceThis summary has been carefully crafted to avoid repetition, adhering to the strict requirement of presenting unique information in each section.
