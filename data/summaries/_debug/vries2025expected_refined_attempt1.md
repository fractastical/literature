Okay, here’s a revised summary of the paper, addressing all the points and constraints outlined above.### Expected Free Energy-based Planning as Variational InferenceThis paper investigates planning under uncertainty by formulating it as a variational inference problem. The core contribution lies in demonstrating that Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization naturally emerges from a variational approach, where the EFE is derived from a generative model augmented with epistemic and prior considerations. Specifically, the EFE is derived from a generative model incorporating prior and epistemic factors. The EFE is derived from a generative model incorporating prior and epistemic factors.The paper establishes a framework where the EFE is derived from a generative model incorporating prior and epistemic factors.
