An Active Inference perspective on Neurofeedback TrainingThe neurofeedback (NFT) field has long grappled with questions of efficacy and mechanisms, particularly regarding the factors driving successful outcomes. This paper proposes a novel approach to understanding NFT, framing it through the lens of Active Inference (AI). AI provides a theoretical framework for understanding how agents (in this case, subjects undergoing NFT) actively construct their internal models of the world, and how these models influence their behavior. This paper aims to demonstrate how AI can be used to model the complex interactions involved in NFT, providing a more mechanistic understanding of the process and potentially leading to more targeted and effective interventions.The authors state: "Neurofeedback is a technique that aims to promote self-regulation of brain activity through real-time feedback." They note that “the effectiveness of NFT is highly variable, and the mechanisms underlying this variability remain poorly understood.” The paper argues that this variability stems from the fact that subjects’ internal models of their own brain activity are often inaccurate or incomplete.The core of the paper’s argument rests on the idea that subjects actively construct their own internal models of their brain activity, and that these models are influenced by the feedback they receive during NFT. The authors state: “The key to understanding NFT is to recognize that subjects are not simply passively responding to feedback, but actively constructing their own internal representations of their brain activity.” They note that “this active construction of internal models is influenced by both the feedback they receive and their prior beliefs about their own brain activity.”The methodology employed in this paper is a theoretical exploration of the Active Inference framework applied to NFT. The authors do not present a specific experimental protocol. Instead, they outline the key components of an AI model of NFT, including:1.The Subject’s Internal Model: This model represents the subject’s beliefs about their own brain activity. It includes a representation of the target brain activity (e.g., the desired level of alpha power) and a representation of the feedback signal. The authors state: “The subject’s internal model is the key to understanding NFT. It is through this model that the subject interprets the feedback and adjusts their behavior.”2.The Feedback Signal: This is the real-time feedback signal provided to the subject during NFT. The authors state: “The feedback signal is the primary source of information for the subject’s internal model.”3.The Inference Mechanism: This is the process by which the subject uses the feedback signal to update their internal model. The authors state: “The inference mechanism is the process by which the subject uses the feedback signal to update their internal model.”The results of this theoretical exploration suggest that the effectiveness of NFT depends on the accuracy of the subject’s internal model. The authors state: “If the subject’s internal model is accurate, the subject will be able to effectively regulate their brain activity. If the subject’s internal model is inaccurate, the subject will be unable to effectively regulate their brain activity.”The authors further argue that the feedback signal itself can influence the accuracy of the subject’s internal model. They state: “The feedback signal can either reinforce or disrupt the subject’s existing beliefs about their own brain activity.”The authors conclude that Active Inference provides a powerful framework for understanding NFT. They state: “By understanding how subjects construct their internal models of their brain activity, we can develop more effective interventions for promoting self-regulation.”The paper’s key findings can be summarized as follows:1.The effectiveness of NFT depends on the accuracy of the subject’s internal model.2.The feedback signal can influence the accuracy of the subject’s internal model.3.Active Inference provides a powerful framework for understanding NFT.The authors state: “The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that Active Inference can be used to model the complex interactions involved in NFT.”The authors conclude that Active Inference offers a promising new perspective on the field of neurofeedback. They state: “By understanding how subjects construct their internal models of their brain activity, we can develop more effective interventions for promoting self-regulation.”The authors further state: “This framework provides a mechanistic understanding of how individuals learn to regulate their brain activity through neurofeedback.”The authors conclude: “Active Inference provides a powerful framework for understanding NFT and developing more effective interventions for promoting self-regulation.”
