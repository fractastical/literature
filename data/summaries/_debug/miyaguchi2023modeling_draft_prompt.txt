Abstract
Hybrid face-to-face and online communication have the problem that only the
local participants are stimulated and the remote participants are excluded or the local
participants forget about the remote participants. These problems were considered as the
lack of sense of the presence of remote participants. As the first quantitative approach to
the presence, to the best of our knowledge, we formulated the sense of the presence of a
remote participant in hybrid communication using a Bayesian framework. We also applied
the knowledge gained from the simulation with the Bayesian model to the avatar robot’s
intervention behavior and encouraged the local participants to speak by intervening in the
remote participant’s behavior using an avatar robot. We hypothesized that beliefs about the
remote participant’s mental states would be a factor in the remote participant’s presence.
We formulated presence as model evidence for other’s mental state. We then modeled the
influence of the avatar robot’s behavior on the local participants’ statements using an active
inference framework that included the presence of a remote participant as a latent variable.
Through simulations with the model, it was possible to predict that the gaze behavior of
the avatar robot would encourage local participants to speak. Based on the simulation
results, we designed the gaze behavior of an avatar robot. Finally, we examined the
effectiveness of the designed gaze behavior of the avatar robot. The gaze behavior
expressed more of the remote participant’s attention and interest in local participants, but
local participants expressed fewer opinions in the meeting tasks. The results suggest that
gaze behavior increased the presence of the remote participant and discouraged the local
participant from speaking in the context of the experimental task. We believe that presence
has a sufficiently large influence on whether participants want to express an opinion. It is
worth investigating the influence of presence and its control methods using Bayesian
1
models.
Introduction
In recent years, many conferences and lectures have been conducted in a hybrid
format combining face-to-face and online communication. Problems with hybrid
communication have been reported [1]. In particular, the problem is that only local
participants are stimulated and the remote participants are excluded and the local
participants forget the remote participants. Several studies have attributed the problems
encountered in hybrid communication to a lack of remote participants and have attempted
to increase their presence. For example, Yankelovich et al. developed a device that
combines a remotely controllable display and a high-quality speaker to increase the social
presence of remote participants [1]. Van Dijk et al. proposed a 3D interface that can
naturally reflect gaze direction in images by arranging the placement of cameras and
images and investigating the effects on the perception of social presence [2]. However,
these studies are limited to qualitative discussions, and to our knowledge, a quantitative
approach to presence using mathematical models has not yet been proposed.
The mathematical model allows us to comprehensively predict the effects of
changes in latent variables on the presence and the effects of presence. These predictions
may exceed human intuition. In addition, we can research along the cycle: first, we predict
the effect of changes in the set of latent variables on presence through simulations and then
discover new latent variables through experiments and update the model. Thus, we believe
that proposing a mathematical model for presence will enable a more effective approach
to problems related to presence.
Ogasawara et al. formulated a sense of existence for other avatars in VR using a
Bayesian perceptual model [3]. They modeled the sense of existence as the model evidence
for the spatiotemporal localization of the avatar. In short, they physically modeled the
senses of the avatar. However, we have formulated the presence of remote participants,
which causes problems in hybrid communication. By exploring the causes of these
problems, we set up a hypothesis about the factors of presence.
In addition, using a mathematical model of presence, we propose an avatar robot
behavior that promotes the statements of local participants. In groups with different status
levels, low-status members tend to be reluctant to express their opinions about
interpersonal risks. We used an avatar robot to intervene in the behavior of high-status
2
members in an attempt to solve this problem.
This study has two objectives. First, the presence of a remote participant in hybrid
communication is formulated. Second, we apply findings from the simulation with a
Bayesian model to the intervening behavior of the avatar robot and promote the local
participant’s statement by intervening with the avatar robot in the remote participant’s
behavior.
In the mathematical modeling of the sense of the presence of a remote person, we
first explain the conversational experiment with an avatar robot and the hypothesis for the
presence factor. We then introduce active inference and explain the mathematical modeling
of the remote participants’ presence.
In designing the gaze behavior of the avatar robot that encourages the expression
of opinions by local participants in the discussion, we explain the mathematical modeling
and simulations for designing the avatar robot’s behavior that promotes local participants’
statements. The focus was on statements made in groups with different social status levels.
The model considers the presence of a remote participant as a latent variable. In addition,
an avatar robot’s gaze behavior based on the simulation findings is proposed.
In Experiment: Effect of the intervention in the gaze behavior of the avatar robot
on the statements of local participants, we describe an experiment to investigate the
effectiveness of the designed gaze behavior. We recreated a situation in which low-status
members were reluctant to express their opinions with groups with different social status
levels.
Methods
Significance of the use of the avatar robot
In this study, an avatar robot as a device for remote participation is used in hybrid
communication. The avatar robot is a prototype developed by Sony Group Corporation,
with whom we are conducting joint research. Fig 1 shows an overview of an avatar robot.
The avatar robot plays the voice of the remote party through the speaker. The avatar robot
also mirrors the remote participant’s gaze, blink, and head rotation.

Fig 1. Avatar robot used in this study.
These two features are important for the use of avatar robots. First, the avatar
robot accurately reproduced the gaze direction of the remote participant. In hybrid systems
that use a plane display, it is difficult to determine the gaze direction of a remote participant.
It has been reported that the transmission of gaze direction is more accurate when a robot's
three-dimensional head rotates than when a remote participant's face appears on a display
[4]. The avatar robot rotates its head along with the head rotation of the remote participant.
We believe that the avatar robot can accurately reproduce the gaze direction.
Second, the avatar robot can intervene in the transmission of a remote participant’s
nonverbal behavior (i.e., head rotation, gazing, and blinking). The avatar robot not only
reflects the behavior of the remote participant but also edits, transforms, or automates it.
Non-verbal behaviors express emotions [5] and cognitive states [6]. We have attempted to
control presence by intervening in non-verbal behaviors and controlling the transmission
of emotions and cognitive states.
Mathematical modeling of the sense of the presence of a remote
person
Conversational experiment with an avatar robot to formulate hypotheses
about the definition and factors of presence.
We conducted a conversational experiment with an avatar robot as a first step in
the mathematical modeling of presence. The purpose was to formulate a hypothesis about
the definition and factors of the presence of remote participants.
One remote participant and three local participants took part in a conversation task.
Fig 2 shows the arrangement of participants in the conversational experiment. Two
4
conversation formats (presentation and discussion) were set as tasks. The reason for this is
that it is necessary to observe or experience different conversation scenes (i.e., where one
participant talks to others, where there are free alternations, and where one participant
addresses another).
Fig 2. Arrangement of participants in the conversation experiment.
The presence being investigated is attributed to problems in hybrid
communication, such as the problem that only local participants are stimulated, that remote
participants are excluded, or that the local participants forget the remote participants.
Therefore, we discuss the reasons why only local participants become excited, why remote
participants are excluded, or why they forget about remote participants. The following
reasons were cited as causes:
 It is difficult for remote participants to take turns during active alternation because
only remote participants experience a delay.
5
 It is difficult for local participants to understand the mental states of remote
participants, such as their thoughts and cognitive states.
 It is difficult for local participants to allow remote participants to take turns because
they cannot predict the remote participants’ responses.
Of these three points, we focused on the bottom two, which pertain to the
recognition of remote participants. The avatar robot can display a remote participant’s gaze,
blink, and head rotation, but it cannot display other behaviors, such as facial expressions
and hand gestures. A hybrid system that shows a remote participant on a display can
represent the remote participant’s facial expressions and hand gestures, but it is difficult to
know where the remote participant is looking. In any hybrid system, the cues to the mental
states of the remote participants were less than in face-to-face communication. Therefore,
it is difficult to determine the mental state of a remote participant. In addition, it is difficult
to predict remote participants’ responses when they are unaware of their mental states. The
risk of communication errors, such as speaking to a remote participant who is not ready to
respond and the difficulty of speaking in accordance with the remote participant's thoughts,
seems to be the cause of the difficulties in talking to remote participants.
We hypothesized that the difficulty in detecting the mental state of a remote
participant was related to problems in hybrid communication and the presence of remote
participants. We also hypothesized that beliefs about remote participants’ mental states
would be a factor in remote participants’ presence. In this study, we used the active
inference framework [7] to mathematically capture beliefs about a remote participant’s
mental state.
Active inference
In this section, the active inference method is described, which is used to model
the sense of presence. A detailed explanation can be found in [7].
Active inference is a mathematical framework based on the idea that perception
and learning can be understood as minimizing variational free energy (VFE) and action
selection and planning. Decision-making can be understood as minimizing the expected
free energy (EFE) [7]. To explain active inference, Bayesian inference is discussed first.
Bayesian inference uses Bayes’ theorem to infer the hidden states of the external
world from the observations generated by these hidden states. The term “hidden” here
means that the state itself cannot be observed directly but can only be inferred from
6
observation (sensory stimuli). Eq. (1) shows the Bayes’ theorem.
𝑝(𝑜|𝑠)𝑝(𝑠)
𝑝(𝑠|𝑜) = (1)
𝑝(𝑜)
The hidden state is denoted by s, and the observation is denoted by o. The term
𝑝(𝑠|𝑜) is the posterior encoding belief regarding the state obtained by inference. The term
𝑝(𝑜|𝑠) is the likelihood of encoding knowledge about the mapping between the
observation and state. The term 𝑝(𝑠) is the prior encoding prediction of the state before
the observation. The term 𝑝(𝑜) is the model evidence encoding the plausibility of the
generative model. Bayes’ theorem states that the likelihood and prior are combined to
derive the posterior.
Bayes’ theorem, however, cannot be computed directly for all but the simplest
distributions. This is because calculating the model evidence requires summing the
probabilities of the observations under all possible states of the generative model. Eq. (2)
shows the formula for model evidence:
𝑝(𝑜) = (cid:3533)𝑝(𝑜,𝑠) = (cid:3533)𝑝(𝑜|𝑠)𝑝(𝑠) (2)
(cid:3046) (cid:3046)
Therefore, variational inference was performed to approximate the posterior. An
approximate posterior 𝑞(𝑠) is introduced. The VFE was then calculated and expressed as
the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence) between 𝑞(𝑠) and the generative model
𝑝(𝑜,𝑠). KL divergence corresponds to a measure that calculates the dissimilarity between
two distributions. Eq. (3) shows the VFE.
𝑞(𝑠)
𝐹 = (cid:3533)𝑞(𝑠)ln (3)
𝑝(𝑜,𝑠)
(cid:3046)
Variationally update 𝑞(𝑠) . If 𝑞(𝑠) is found to minimize the VFE, then
approximate the true posterior 𝑝(𝑠|𝑜) at that point.
This explains the perceptual mechanism in active inferences. Next, action
selection is discussed.
In action selection, the brain also makes decisions that provide future observations
to minimize the VFE. However, future outcomes have not yet been observed. Therefore,
the EFE (i.e., the expected value of the VFE) was calculated and minimized. The expected
free energy of the action policy π is expressed in Eq. (4) [7]:
7
𝑞(𝑠|𝜋)
𝐺 = (cid:3533)𝑞(𝑜,𝑠|𝜋)ln (4)
(cid:3095) 𝑝(𝑜,𝑠|𝜋)
(cid:3046),(cid:3042)
𝑞(𝑠|𝜋)
= (cid:3533)𝑞(𝑜,𝑠|𝜋)ln −(cid:3533)𝑞(𝑜|𝜋)ln𝑝(𝑜|𝜋)
𝑝(𝑠|𝑜,𝜋)
(cid:3046),(cid:3042) (cid:3042)
𝑞(𝑠|𝜋)
≈ (cid:3533)𝑞(𝑜,𝑠|𝜋)ln −(cid:3533)𝑞(𝑜|𝜋)ln𝑝(𝑜|𝐶)
𝑞(𝑠|𝑜,𝜋)
(cid:3046),(cid:3042) (cid:3042)
Two substitutions are made in the third line of Eq. (4). First, the approximate
posterior 𝑞(𝑜,𝑠|𝜋) replaces the true posterior 𝑝(𝑠|𝑜,𝜋) . Second, 𝑝(𝑜|𝐶) replaces
𝑝(𝑜|𝜋) in the second term. C is the prior preference, and 𝑝(𝑜|𝐶) encodes the observation
that the agent prefers based on the prior preference.
Mathematical modeling of presence using an active inference framework
The sense of the presence of the remote participant in hybrid communication is
modeled using active inference.
Ogasawara et al. modeled the sense of the existence of another person’s avatar in
VR as the magnitude of model evidence or the smallness of surprise when perceiving
stimuli related to the spatiotemporal localization of the avatar [3]. We hypothesized that
beliefs about the mental states of remote participants would be a factor in the presence of
the remote participants in the conversation experiment. The sense of presence by
considering beliefs about a remote participant’s mental state was modeled by using the
model proposed by Ogasawara et al.
The sense of the presence of remote participants in hybrid communication was
modeled as the model evidence of the mental states of remote participants. The large
amount of model evidence for the mental state of a remote participant indicates its clarity.
Therefore, the model evidence is associated with the presence of remote participants. With
this model, the presence of remote participants can be expressed as latent variables in an
active inference framework.
Designing the gaze behavior of the avatar robot that encourages
the expression of opinions by local participants in the discussion
In this section, the behavior of the avatar robot is designed that encourages the
expression of opinions by local participants in the discussion and solves the problem of
expressing opinions in groups with different social status levels. For this purpose, the
8
influence of the gaze behavior of a high-status member on the statements of the low-status
members was modeled, including the presence modeled in the active inference framework.
Then, simulations using the model were performed, and insights were obtained for
designing the avatar robot’s behavior.
Problems in expressing opinions in groups with different levels of social
status
In group discussions, sharing information and exchanging opinions are important
because they enhance the performance of the group. Sharing information can allow groups
with divergent knowledge or recognition levels to pool and summarize all information [8].
It is reported that that disagreement in groups is associated with increased creativity [9]
and better decision making [10].
However, voicing opinions to share information or express dissenting views is
often associated with interpersonal risks. Speaking out against the prevailing opinion in
the group can lead to social exclusion from the group [11]. Expressing opinions can elicit
critical feedback and create an impression of incompetence in others. If there are people
in the group who can influence their promotion or salary, expressing their opinions can be
a more concrete and risky action [12]. Therefore, in groups with different status levels, the
problem arises that low-status members hesitate to express their opinions because they fear
interpersonal risks.
Mathematical modeling of the influence of the gaze behavior of a high-
status member on the statements of low-status members
The characteristics and behaviors of high-status members influence the statements
of others. Whether the team leader is cooperative or coaching-oriented has been reported
to be a factor predicting a team’s psychological safety [12]. Psychological safety is the
shared belief that a team is safe to take risks in interpersonal relationships and is related to
team members’ learning behaviors [12]. Shim et al. found that differences in group
members' influence decreased when a group leader directed more gaze toward a low-status
member. [13].
We promoted the statements of low-status members by intervening in the non-
verbal behavior of high-status members using the avatar robot. To design the behavior of
an avatar robot to promote the statements of low-status members, the influence of the
behavior of a high-status member on the statements of low-status members was modeled
9
using an active inference framework.
Fig 3 shows the proposed Bayesian model of the influence of a high-status
member’s behavior on the statements of low-status members. s is the hidden state; o is the
observation; A is likelihood mapping between states and observations (observation model);
B is the transition matrix; C is the prior preferences; and D is the initial state priors. The
model was divided into three fields: Level 1-1, Level 2, and Level 1-2. In all fields, the
agent of inference is a low-status member. The fields are described as follows:
10

A: likelihood mapping between states and observations (observation model), B: transition
matrices, C: prior preferences, D: initial state priors, G: expected free energy, s: states, o:
observations, π: posterior distribution over actions. Superscripts indicate the fields to
which the variables belong. The subscript represents the time step. In all fields, the agent
of inference is a low-status member.
In Level 1-1, a low-standing member infers whether a high-standing member is
attentive based on the gaze behavior of that member. Humans can tell what other people
are paying attention to from their gazes [14]. Therefore, an agent receiving a direct gaze
infers that the person is attentive to the agent. Alternatively, the agent receiving one’s
averted gaze infers that the person is not paying attention to the agent. The observational
model 𝑝(cid:3435)𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869))(cid:3627)𝑠((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869))(cid:3439) is described by Eq. (5). 𝜁 is the precision of Level 1-1 of the
(cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)
observation model. 𝜎() is the softmax function. Exp(−4) is added to prevent the
formation of ln(0). By transforming lines 3 and 4 in Eq. (5), the noise associated with the
observations and the ambiguities in the mapping between the observations and states can
be accounted for.

(cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869) (cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)
The agent infers the mental state of the high-status member at Level 1-1. Therefore,
the model evidence of the inference in Level 1-1 corresponds to the sense of the presence
of a high-status member.
In Level 2, a low-status member infers whether they are included in a group based
on the results of the inference in Level 1-1. An included state corresponds to a high level
of psychological safety. Hirak et al. [15] reported that the leader’s inclusivity is positively
correlated with the psychological safety perceived by other members. A leader’s inclusivity
is defined as the leader’s openness and accessibility in interactions with other members. It
is assumed that the agent thinks that they are included in the group from the attention and
interests of the group of high-status members. In contrast, it is assumed that the agent
thinks that the high-status members' unconcern is exclusive to them. The observational
11
model 𝑝(cid:3435)𝑠((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869))(cid:3627)𝑠((cid:2870))(cid:3439) is described by Eq. (6).

In Level 1-2, a low-status member selects their action: expressing an opinion or
not. Expressing an opinion leads to group feedback. It is assumed that the agent learns
whether the group agrees with their opinion. Observational model 𝑝(cid:3435)𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870))(cid:3627)𝑠((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870))(cid:3439) is
described as Eq. (7). The observational model varies when the probability of a faulty
inference is considered.

The agent has prior preferences for future observations associated with action
selection at Level 1-2. Prior preferences encode the rewards and aversions gained from the
observations. Expressing an opinion involves interpersonal risk. Expressing a dissenting
opinion can lead to social exclusion from a group [11]. We established a negative
preference for observing 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡. Considering that psychological safety promotes
learning behaviors with interpersonal risk [12], we formulated the magnitude of negative
preference changes by inclusiveness in the group inferred at Level 2.
It can be modeled that prior preferences depend on context. In this case, the EFE
is described by Eq. (8) [16]:
𝑞(cid:3435)𝑠((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870))(cid:3627)𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870)),𝜋((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870))(cid:3439)

The second term 𝑝(cid:4672)𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870))(cid:4698)𝑠 ((cid:2870)) (cid:4673) in Eq. (8) is the prior preference, which depends
(cid:3099)
on the context at time τ. When the agent assumes that they are included in the group and
that psychological safety is high, the agent perceives it as safe to take interpersonal risks.
In contrast, when the agent assumes that they are excluded from the group and
psychological safety is low, the agent perceives the danger of taking interpersonal risks.

Therefore, a negative preference is set only for 𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870)) = 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 when 𝑠((cid:2870)) =
𝑒𝑥𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑑. Prior preference is described as context-dependent, as in Eq. (9).
𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870)) = {𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡},
𝑠((cid:2870)) = {𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑑 𝑒𝑥𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑑}

The EFE of Eq. (8) allows for the consideration of prior preferences as a function
of the discrete context. In modeling the influence of the level of psychological safety on
action selection, we formulated the prior preference as shown in Eq. (10).
𝐶((cid:2870)):𝑝(cid:3435)𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870))(cid:3627)𝐶(cid:3439) = 𝑝(cid:3435)𝑠((cid:2870)) = 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑑(cid:3439)𝑝(cid:3435)𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870))(cid:3627)𝑠((cid:2870)) = 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑑(cid:3439)

Then, EFE is described in Eq. (11).

Simulations based on the Bayesian model
We performed simulations using the proposed model of the influence of a high-
status member’s gaze behavior on the low-status members’ statements to design the
intervention behavior of an avatar robot.
The action selection probability of a low-status member in each condition was
simulated. The action selection probability is calculated using Eq. (12).
𝜋 = {𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠 𝑎𝑛 𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑑𝑜 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑒 𝑎𝑛 𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑜𝑛}
𝑝(𝜋) = 𝜎(−𝛾𝐺) (12)
The term γ is the expected precision of EFE. The initial value was set to 1. Term
G is a vector consisting of the EFEs of the two actions. The term 𝜎() is the softmax
function. We used the MATLAB code spm_MDP_VB_X_tutorial.m from [7] to perform
the simulations.
The avatar robot can intervene in observation in Level 1-1 (𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869))), likelihood
mapping between states and observations in Level 1-1 (𝑝(cid:3435)𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869))(cid:3627)𝑠((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869))(cid:3439) ), and prior in
Level 1-1 (𝑝(𝑠((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869))) ), which express predictions before observation. Conditions that
changed the model variables were simulated. The simulation conditions are listed in Table
13
1. By observing the action selection that follows the EFE, we set the initial value of the
EFE’s expected precision (γ) to one.

Superscripts indicate the fields to which the variables belong.
In condition 1, we simulated the action selection probability when the agent
observes the direct gaze of the high-status member as observation 𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)) . We set the
precision of the observation model to 0.2 to account for the uncertainties in the mapping
0.5
between the inferred state and observed gaze. We set the prior as 𝑝(cid:3435)𝑠((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869))(cid:3439) = (cid:4674) (cid:4675) under
0.5
the assumption that the agent equally predicts whether the high-standing member pays
attention to and is interested in them.
In condition 2, the action selection probability was simulated when the agent
observes the averted gaze of a high-status member as observation 𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)). By comparing
the results of conditions 1 and 2, the influence of the avatar robot’s conversion of an
averted gaze to a direct gaze on a low-status member’s statement was predicted. We set the
14
precision of the observation model prior to the same values as condition 1.
Under condition 3, the action selection probability was simulated by changing the
precision of the observation model 𝑝(cid:3435)𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869))(cid:3627)𝑠((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869))(cid:3439). The prior was set as 𝑝(cid:3435)𝑠((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869))(cid:3439) =
0.5
(cid:4674) (cid:4675) under the assumption that the agent equally predicts whether the high-status member
0.5
pays attention to and is interested in them. The influence of a high-status member changing
their gaze behavior to one that expressed more attention and interest in what the low-status
member said was predicted.
In condition 4, the action selection probability was simulated by changing the
prior 𝑝(cid:3435)𝑠((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869))(cid:3439). The precision of the observational model was set to 0.2 to account for
uncertainties in the mapping between the inferred state and observed gaze. The prior
encodes the prediction of whether the high-status member pays attention and interest to
the agent. The influence of adding a prior motion [17] to the gaze behavior of the high-
status member by the avatar robot, which enabled the prediction of the gaze movement on
what the low-status member said, was predicted.
Table 2 lists the simulation results of action selection probability under conditions
1 and 2. The probability of expressing an opinion is higher under condition 1 than under
condition 2. Thus, it is predicted that changing the gaze behavior of the high-status member
from an averted gaze to a direct gaze will encourage the low-status member to speak.
Fig 4 shows the simulation results of the action selection probability under
condition 3. The higher the precision of the observation model, the higher the probability
of expressing an opinion. Therefore, it is predicted that changing the gaze behavior of high-
status members to one that expresses more attention and interest will encourage a low-
status member to express an opinion.
Fig 5 shows the simulation results of the action selection probability under
condition 4. The higher the degree of prediction that a high-status member will pay
attention and show interest in the agent, the higher the probability of an opinion being
expressed. Based on this result, it is predicted that adding preliminary movements to the
gaze behavior of high-status members would encourage low-status members to speak.
Based on these findings, we designed the gaze behavior of an avatar robot. In this
study, we designed the gaze behavior when the remote participant spoke, which seemed to
express more attention to local participants.

Fig 4. The influence of precision of the Level 1-1 observation model on the probability
that a low-status member expresses an opinion.
Precision adjusts the ambiguity of the mapping between states and observations. Higher
precision indicates that the mapping is more precise. The observation model in Level 1-1
is a mapping between the attentional states of high-status members (attentive/unconcerned
to a low-status member) and their gaze behavior.
Fig 5. The influence of prior distribution in Level 1-1 （𝒑(cid:3435)𝒔(𝟏(cid:2879)𝟏)(cid:3439) = [𝒂 𝟏−𝒂]）on
the probability that a low-status member expresses an opinion.
The state derived by a low-status member in Level 1-1 is the attention state of a high-status
member (attentive/unconcerned to a low-status member). A higher value of a means that a
low-status member predicts that a high-status member is more likely to direct their
attention and interest toward a low-status member.
Design of the gaze behavior of the avatar robot
Based on the simulation results, the gaze behavior of an avatar robot was designed
in conjunction with a remote participant’s speech. First, the requirements for gaze behavior
are explained. Second, the design of a gaze behavior is explained that satisfies these
requirements. Then, the actual designed gaze behavior is explained.
17
Based on the initial simulation results, we determined to make the avatar robot
automatically cast a direct gaze, regardless of the remote participant’s gaze behavior.
However, if the gaze behavior appears to be automated, the local participants may not
perceive that the remote participant is paying attention to or is interested in them. Thus,
the first requirement is that gaze behavior should be natural and not artificial. We also
predicted that gaze behavior expressing more attention, interest, and preliminary
movement would encourage low-status members to speak in the simulations. Therefore,
the second requirement is that gaze behavior should express more attention and interest.
We used a preliminary movement to satisfy this requirement.
Next, the design of a gaze behavior is explained that satisfies these two
requirements. In this study, natural behavior is designed by using the techniques and ideas
of animators. Animators express vivid behaviors by emphasizing and exaggerating
necessary behavioral features and omitting unnecessary behavioral features [17].
Therefore, our design guidelines emphasize behavioral features that can be a cue to pay
attention for local participants and omit the rest. It is likely that this guideline realizes a
gaze behavior that satisfies both requirements.
Finally, the designed gaze behavior is described. Table 3 lists the behavioral
features incorporated into the gaze behavior of the avatar robot and their meanings. We
implemented these behavioral features in the gaze behavior while a remote participant was
speaking.

Experiment: Effect of the intervention in the gaze behavior of
the avatar robot on the statements of local participants
Gaze behavior of the avatar robot used in the experiment
Participants were divided into an experimental and a control group. For each
group, we used the different gaze behavior of the avatar robot when the remote participant
(the researcher) spoke.
For the experimental groups, the avatar robot described in the previous section
was used. In this task, the researcher acted as a remote participant using an avatar robot,
and the two participants were local participants. Fig 6 shows the arrangement of the
participants and the avatar robot in the experiment. The avatar robot looked at each
participant in the experimental group in turn. When the researcher breathed, the avatar
robot changed the direction of its gaze.
In the control group, the avatar robot looked at the center of the two participants
throughout the researcher's speech. To avoid an unnatural impression, we implemented and
used a blink pattern in which the avatar robot blinked once after three seconds and twice
after another three seconds.
The specific implementation of the gaze behaviors is described in the Supporting
Information.

Participants
Participants were recruited from among students at the University of Tokyo who
had no visual or hearing impairments and whose native language was Japanese, using both
snowball sampling and voluntary responses. Twenty-two students (16 male, six female) in
the experimental group and 22 students (16 male, five female, one no answer) participated
in this study. For controlling the influence of acquaintances and gender combinations, we
created pairs of same-gender participants who did not know each other. A female pair who
was acquainted with each other and a pair of female and no-answer participants who had
selected the same candidate before the discussion were excluded from the analysis.
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of
Engineering, The University of Tokyo (Approval No. KE22-59). All study participants
provided informed consent.
20
Design
We used a hidden-profile task [8] to quantitatively investigate whether local
participants’ statements were promoted. In the hidden-profile task, participants received
partial information about their choices. Participants can only choose the best option if they
share unique information with each other. Therefore, a hidden-profile task is used to study
group information elaboration [13] and team performance in learning [20].
A group consisting of one researcher and two participants performed a hidden
profile task. Participants read the profiles of three hypothetical candidates for the student
body president and then decided which candidate was best suited for the position. The
profiles did not include complete information about the candidates and contained unique
information provided to only one participant. We examined whether each participant’s
statement was promoted by evaluating the amount of unique information shared.
Participants played a game that reproduced the relationship between their boss
and subordinates during discussions in the hidden-profile task. We call this the boss–
subordinate game. The researcher played the game in the role of the boss, and participants
acted as subordinates. We calculated each participant’s score using the boss-subordinate
game rules. Participants were then told that in addition to the gratuities, they would receive
snacks according to their scores. After the experiment, all participants were given the same
number of snacks. The boss-subordinate game states that a subordinate who disagrees with
their boss has the risk of a point deduction for their statements. This risk is related to the
subjective judgment of the boss. This rule structure reproduces a situation in which low-
status members are reluctant to express their opinions because of the interpersonal risks.
The profiles were designed so that each participant supported a different
candidate: candidate B or candidate C. The researcher supported candidate B as the
supervisor. Thus, a participant who supported candidate C risked their statements
according to the boss-subordinate game rules. The profiles were created by modifying the
method used in [8].
In the actual experiments, there were cases where the participants did not support
the candidates as intended. In such cases, the researcher selected and supported candidates
B or C, so there were participants who agreed and disagreed with the boss. We refer to a
participant who agrees with the boss as Participant 1 and a participant who disagrees with
the boss as Participant 2.
21
Procedure
After completing the informed consent form, the participants completed
questionnaire testing personality traits prior to the experiment. They then began the
hidden-profile task. This hidden-profile task consists of individual and discussion phases.
In the individual phase, each participant reads the profile and indicates which candidates
they support at that time.
Then, the researcher explains the boss-subordinate game that is played in the
discussion phase. The researcher then moved to another room and connected to an avatar
robot. After confirming that the connection to the avatar robot was successful, the
researcher asked the participants to report the candidates they had selected for the
individual phase. The order of reporting was as follows: participants who received the
profile that recommended candidate B reported first, followed by those who received the
profile that recommended candidate C.
The researcher then explained the discussion phase and gave an opinion as the
boss (which candidate was supported and why). While the researcher explained this, the
avatar robot looked at each participant in turn in the experimental group. In the control
group, the avatar robot continued to gaze at the middle of the two participants, while the
researcher gave an opinion. After the researcher expressed an opinion as the boss, the
participants engaged in a free discussion about which candidate should be nominated for
student body president. During the free discussion, the researcher did not speak, and the
avatar robot continued to observe the center of the two participants.
The participants reported to the researcher the candidate who should be nominated
as student body president after reaching an agreement within five minutes of the start of
the free discussion. The hidden profile task was completed when the researcher received
the report. The researcher distributed a questionnaire asking for unique information shared
by the group during the free discussion, as well as subjective ratings of the discussion
phase experience. After debriefing and conducting the interviews, the participants received
snacks as an additional reward and were dismissed.
Measures
Objective and subjective indexes were used to assess the effect of the avatar
robot's gaze behavior on participants.
As an objective index, the amount of unique information shared by each
22
participant during the free discussion was measured. The amount of unique information
shared by Participant 1 (who agreed with the researcher as the boss) was referred to as
sum1. The amount of unique information shared by Participant 2 (who disagreed with the
researcher as the boss) was referred to as sum2. The profile that Participant 1 had read
contained six unique items of information that supported the boss’s opinion and three items
of information that did not support the boss’s opinion. The amount of shared unique
information that supported the boss’s opinion was measured, and this number is referred
to as agreement1. That unique information indicated that the candidate supported by the
boss was desirable or indicated that the candidate not supported by the boss was
undesirable. Additionally, the amount of shared unique information that did not support
the boss’s opinion was measured, and this number was referred to as disapproval1. The
total number of agreement1 and disapproval1 responses was sum1. Participant 1 answered
questions about the unique information they had shared with the group during the free
discussion from all the unique information. Participant 2 read nine unique pieces of
information that did not support the boss’s opinion. Participant 2 answered questions about
the unique information they shared with the group during the free discussion from all the
unique information.
In addition, the amount of unique information that the participants were hesitant
to share was measured. The number of responses from Participant 1 was called hesitation1,
and the number of responses from Participant 2 was called hesitation2.
Subjective indexes to measure the effects on participants were used that were not
included in the objective indexes. The subjective indexes were based on a model of the
influence of a high-ranking member’s gaze behavior on the opinions of low-ranking
members.
How easy it was to identify the gaze direction while the researcher was connected
to the avatar robot was measured. It was checked whether participants could observe the
direct gaze of the high-ranking member (the researcher) at Level 1-1 of the model.
Perceptions of attention and interest, while the researcher was connected to the
avatar robot, were measured. Perceptions of attention and interest indicate whether
participants infer that they are receiving attention and interest from the high-ranking
member in Level 1-1 of the model. Perception of attention and interest is an index of how
large the model evidence is for the model from which participants inferred that they
received attention and interest from high-ranking members (i.e., how large the presence of
high-ranking members is).
23
We then measured the inclusiveness of each group. We checked whether
participants in Level 2 inferred from their perception of attention and interest that they
were included in the group.
The ease with which participants were able to express their opinions during the
free discussion was measured. It was checked whether participants felt that it was easy to
select the action of expressing themselves in Level 1-2.
Participants responded on a 7-level Likert scale to four of the above items: ease
of identifying gaze direction, perception of attention and interest, involvement in the group,
and ease of expressing opinions.
It was assumed that the results would be influenced by the participants’
personality traits. Therefore, prior to the hidden profile task, participant’s extraversion and
neuroticism using the Big-Five marker was measured [21].
After debriefing, participants were asked about whether they perceived any risk
in sharing information during the free discussion and what their impression of the avatar
robot was while the researcher was speaking.
In addition, a video of the discussion phase of the hidden profile task was recorded
and used to discuss the experimental results.
Hypothesis
The gaze behavior used in the experimental group was designed to express
attention and interest to local participants. Thus, we hypothesized the following:
H1. The ease with which gaze direction could be identified increased in the experimental
group compared to the control group for both Participant 1 (a participant who agreed
with the researcher as the boss) and Participant 2 (a participant who disagreed with
the researcher as the boss).
H2. The perception of attention and interest increased in the experimental group compared
to the control group for both Participants 1 and 2.
Based on the model of the influence of the gaze behavior of the high-status member
on the statements of low-status members, we hypothesized the following:
H3. Participant 2’s inclusivity in the experimental group increased compared to the control
group.
H4. The ease with which participant 2 expresses their opinion increased in the
experimental group compared to the control group.
There seemed to be no significant differences between the two groups in terms of
24
Participant 1’s inclusion in the group and the ease of expressing their opinions. This is
because Participant 1 agreed with the boss and rated the boss highly in both groups.
In addition, we hypothesize the following:
H5. Index sum2 will increase in the experimental group compared to the control group.
H6. Index hesitation 2 will decrease in the experimental group compared to the control
group.
This was due to the fact that the designed gaze behavior promoted the statements of
Participant 2’s statements with interpersonal risks. In contrast, Participant 1 had low risk
in their statements because they contained a lot of clear information that supported the
boss’s opinion. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of
sum1 and hesitation1.
Data analysis
We analyzed the results of the experiments with 40 participants (experimental
group: 16 male and four female; control group: 16 male and four female). A between-
subjects analysis was performed. When the personality traits of the participants
(extraversion and neuroticism) were significantly related to the indices, we performed an
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with personality traits as covariates and the participant
group of (experimental group or control group) as a factor. When the effect of the
personality traits of the participants on the indices was not significant, a two-tailed t-test
was performed to compare the experimental and control groups on the objective and
subjective ratings. The threshold for significance (alpha) was 0.05.
Results
Fig 7 shows the amount of unique information shared by a participant who agreed
with the researcher as boss (Participant 1). Fig 8 shows the amount of unique information
shared by a participant who disagreed with the researcher as boss (Participant 2). The index
sum2 was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group (t(18) =
-3.104, p = 0.006). Index sum2 shows the amount of unique information that Participant 2
shared. This result contradicts H5. Moreover, the value of sum1 was also significantly
lower in the experimental group than in the control group (t(18) = -2.137, p = 0.047). The
index sum1 shows the amount of unique information shared by Participant 1.
There were no significant differences between the experimental and control
25
groups for hesitation 2 (t(18) = 0.911, p = 0.828). Thus, H6 was not supported.

Sum1: total of dessent1 and assent1. A participant who agreed with a high status member
had six unique pieces of information that supported the high-status member’s opinion and
three that did not support the high-status member’s opinion.

Hesitation2: number of unique pieces of information that were not shared when
participants hesitated whether or not to share. Sum2: number of unique pieces of
information shared by a participant who disagreed with the high-status member. A
participant who disagreed with the high-status member had nine unique pieces of
information that did not support the high-status member’s opinion.
Fig 9 shows the subjective rating of Participant 1. Fig 10 shows the subjective
rating of Participant 2. For both Participant 1 and Participant 2, the ease of identifying the
gaze direction was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group
(ease of identifying the gaze direction of Participant 1: t(18) = 5.513, p < 0.001, ease of
identifying the gaze direction of Participant 2: t(18) = 2.994, p = 0.008). These results are
consistent with H1.
For both Participant 1 and Participant 2, perceptions of attention and interest were
significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group (Participant 1’s
perception of attention and interest: t(18) = 2.832, p = 0.011. Participant 2’s perception of
attention and interest: t(18) = 2.374, p = 0.029). Thus, H2 is supported.
However, there were no significant differences between the experimental and
control groups in terms of in-group inclusivity or ease of expressing opinions (inclusivity

Discussion
For both Participant 1 and Participant 2, perceptions of attention and interest were
significantly greater in the experimental group than in the control group (Participant 1:
agrees with the researcher as the boss, Participant 2: disagrees with the researcher as the
boss). Therefore, we assumed that the gaze behavior of the avatar robot increased the
presence of the remote participant (the researcher as boss), as hypothesized. We also
received responses from participants such as “I felt like I was being watched,” and “I
assumed the researcher was talking to the participant he was looking at” during the post
debriefing interview. We hypothesize that the gaze behavior increased the model evidence
of each local participant, by inferring that the boss was paying attention and interest to
them, and thus increasing the presence of the remote boss.
However, sum1 and sum2 are significantly smaller in the experimental group than
in the control group, contrary to H5 (Index sum1 and sum2 show the number of unique
pieces of information shared by Participants 1 and 2). We believe that these results are
attributable to the incorrect modeling of Level2 in the constructed model.
In the subordinate game, Participant 2 was at risk of a point reduction if they
expressed an opinion. If the boss chose the “Rejection of an opinion” option when
Participant 2 expressed a dissenting opinion, Participant 2’s score would be reduced.
Therefore, the presence of a boss may have led Participant 2 to be aware that they were
28
being monitored by the boss and to strongly perceive the risks of expressing an opinion.
In other words, we assume that Participant 2 inferred from the boss's attention and interest
at Level 2 of the model that the boss was monitoring them.
Based on this discussion, the model of the influence of a high-status member’s
gaze behavior on low-status members’ statements was updated, as shown in Fig 11.

status member on the statements of low-status members ． Inferred states and

Subscripts indicate the time step. In all fields, the agent of inference is a low-status member.
First, we explain Level 1-1. In this experiment, perceptions of attention and
interest were increased by the gaze behavior of the avatar robot, as hypothesized. Therefore,
the observation model for Level 1-1 is defined in Eq. (13), which is the same as before the
modification.

(cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869) (cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)
Next, Level 2 is described. There was no significant difference between the
experimental and control groups in terms of in-group inclusivity. However, we believe that
the perception of the boss’s attention and interest increased the feeling of being monitored
by the boss. Therefore, we changed the hidden state 𝑠((cid:2870)) from 𝑠((cid:2870)) =
{𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑑 𝑒𝑥𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑑} to 𝑠((cid:2870)) = {𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑑} . We reformulate the
observation model in Level2 as Eq. (14).
𝑠((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)) = {𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑢𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑒𝑑},

(cid:2870) (cid:2870)
Next Level 1-2 is described. The observation model for Level 1-2 is defined in Eq.
(15), which is the same as before the modification.
𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870)) = {𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡},

0.2 0.8
We changed the prior preference in Level 1-2 because the context 𝑠((cid:2870)) is
modified. In the experimental task, being monitored by the boss led low-status members
(participants) to perceive the risks of a point deduction according to the boss-subordinate
30
game rule. Thus, the boss-subordinate game rule determines the risk of disagreeing with
the boss. Therefore, we changed 𝑠((cid:2870)) from 𝑠((cid:2870)) = {𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑑 𝑒𝑥𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑑} to 𝑠((cid:2870)) =
{𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑑} and set a negative preference only to 𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870)) =
𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 when 𝑠((cid:2870)) = 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑑. We reformulate the prior preference at Level 1-
2 as Eq. (16).
𝑜((cid:2869)(cid:2879)(cid:2870)) = {𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡},

The simulations were performed with the updated model. We changed observation

Superscripts indicate the fields to which the variables belong.
The simulation results in Table 9 indicate that the probability of speaking up in
31
condition 1 is lower than that in condition 2, so the high-status member (or the avatar
robot) giving a direct gaze to the low-status members withholds their statements. The
experimental result that sum2 was lower in the experimental groups than that in the control
groups was supported by simulations with the updated model.
We believe that Participant 2’s withholding of statements led to the reduction of
sum1 in the experimental groups. When Participant 2 did not say very much, Participant 1
did not need to state much about the object. In addition, a significant positive correlation
was found between sum2 and sum1 (r = 0.587, N = 20, p = 0.007).
The gaze behavior of the avatar robot was only performed before the free
discussion, in which participants expressed their opinions. Nevertheless, gaze behavior
significantly increased the presence of remote participants and influenced the statements
of local participants in the free discussion.
Conclusion
In this study, we formulated sense of presence as model evidence for inferring the
mental states of others. We then proposed that gaze behavior should increase the sense of
presence, which is the model evidence, to infer that the remote participant is attentive to
the local participants. Simulations following the model predicted that gaze behavior would
promote the local participants’ statements. We investigated whether the designed gaze
behavior promoted local participants’ expressing an opinion using the meeting task that
reproduced the discussion of a group with different standings. The experimental results
suggest that the gaze behavior of the avatar robot significantly increases the presence of
the remote participant, which restrains local participants’ from expressing an opinion in
the context of the experimental task.
The gaze behavior of the proposed avatar robot increased the presence of remote
participants. We believe that gaze behavior can contribute to communication in a context
where the presence of the remote participants has a positive effect. For example, when
subordinates want to appeal to their skills or make a contribution to their boss, the presence
of the boss will encourage the subordinates’ statements. In these cases, transforming the
boss’s behavior into the avatar robot’s gaze behavior developed in this study may promote
the subordinates’ statements.
The finding that less attentive behavior while speaking promotes subordinates’
statements in this context can also be used for intervention by an avatar robot. The behavior
32
of an avatar robot can change in this context. The avatar robot may exhibit less attentive
behavior in contexts where the presence of a boss exerts pressure and may exhibit the gaze
behavior developed in this study in contexts where the presence of a boss encourages
subordinates. Therefore, it is important to understand the appropriate presence of remote
participants in each context.
The experimental results showed that the presence of the remote participants
restrained the local participants’ statements. This result is inconsistent with our hypothesis.
However, this indicates that the presence of the model has sufficient influence to constrain
the participants’ statements. In addition, previous studies [1][2] have taken the approach
of increasing presence. However, as the current study shows, presence can have a negative
effect on communication. Therefore, we argue that it is worthwhile to study the influence
of presence and control methods using mathematical models.
This study has some limitations. First, the experiment was conducted with only
Japanese participants. The effects of an avatar robot’s gaze behavior may be different in
different cultures. Second, participants' prior knowledge of the robot's features was not
standardized in this experiment. It is hypothesized that the perception of behavior will be
different when participants believe that the robot reflects behavior of the remote
participants and when they do not.

2 S1 Text. Specific Implementation of the gaze behavior of the avatar robot.
3 Data was collected on the changes in head rotation, gaze, and blinking that
4 accompany gaze behavior. The data were analyzed according to the situation. S2 Table
5 shows the flow of the implemented gaze behavior.
6 Here, the data for the head rotation, gaze, and blink that were used in Behavior 6
7 is described. The graphs of head rotation, gaze, and blink that were used in Behavior 6 are
8 shown in S3–S5 Figs.
9 The head rotation data consisted of three angles: yaw (shake), pitch (nod), and roll
10 (tilt). The three-axis actuator is rotated according to these three angles. In Behavior 6, the
11 pitch was 0°, which corresponded to the angle of eye contact with the local participant,
12 combined with the gaze. Roll did not change from 0°, indicating the lack of head tilt. The
13 yaw changed from -20°, the angle at which the eyes met local participant 2, to 10°, the
14 angle at which the eyes met local participant 1, at 0.52 s after the behavior onset. Owing
15 to the eye design, the absolute value of the angle of eye contact with local Participant 1
16 was smaller than that with local Participant 2.
17 The data for the change in yaw over 0.52 s were generated using the inverse
18 tangent function, as shown in Eq. (S1).

20 The term t is the time from the beginning of the behavior, and ζ is a parameter that
21 adjusts the slow-in/slow-out emphasis. The first term in the third row of Eq. (S1) is the
22 inverted sign of the phase angle of the second-order delay element whose angular
(cid:2869)
23 frequency is ω (𝐺(𝑠) = ). Using Eq (S1), the emphasis of slow-in and slow-out

24 can be adjusted while maintaining the time required for the yaw angle to change the
25 constant.
26 The gaze data are represented as the position of the pupil in coordinates on the xy-
27 plane with 0≤x≤100 and 0≤y≤100. The pupil image is moved to the position defined by
28 the x–y coordinates in the eye display. The x-coordinate (horizontal coordinate) was
37
29 displaced linearly in the direction of gaze shift and then returned slightly in the opposite
30 direction in a time (0.31 s) shorter than the change in yaw angle. This indicates that the
31 eyes moved earlier than the head rotated. The y coordinate (vertical coordinate) was
32 displaced vertically downward with a blink. These eye movements imitated the behavioral
33 features discovered by analyzing the eye-gaze data logs obtained from the avatar robot.
34 The blink data is an integer between 0 and 100, representing the degree of eye
35 opening. At 0, the avatar robot's eyes are meditative, and at 100, its eyes are fully open.
36 Blinks were performed at the beginning of the yaw change and immediately before the end
37 of the yaw change. These were implemented as blinks before and after the head swing.
38 The data of the other behaviors were created by applying the data of Behavior 6.
39 The avatar robot changed its behavior at the start, during breathing, and at the end
40 of the speech of the remote participant, as shown in S5 Table. We coded the start of speech
41 as the time when the 16-bit PCM value of the remote participant's input audio exceeded a
42 certain value. The breath-hold timing was coded as the time in which the 16-bit PCM value
43 of the remote participant's input audio fell below a certain value during Behaviors 2–6.
44 The end of the remote participant's speech was defined as the time at which the participant
45 pressed the button.

   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
