## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a theory that describes the action selection and learning mechanism of an agent in an environment.”
*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle states that systems minimize their free energy, which is a measure of surprise or uncertainty.”
*   Bayesian Belief Updating (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian belief updating is used to update the agent’s beliefs about the state of the environment based on new observations.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is used to optimize the parameters of the generative model.”
*   KL Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “KL divergence is used to measure the difference between two probability distributions.”
*   Softmax Function (exact quote from paper) – “The softmax function is used to convert a vector of real numbers into a probability distribution.”
*   Mean Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “The mean-field approximation assumes that the state variables are independent of each other.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for machine learning algorithms.”

## Datasets

*   T-maze Environment (exact quote from paper) – “The T-maze environment is a standard benchmark for active inference experiments.”
*   The T-maze environment is a standard benchmark for active inference experiments.
