### OverviewThis paper investigates the use of physiological stress, specifically cortisol secretion, as a mechanism for allostatic regulation under the active inference framework. The authors propose a computational model that couples information-theoretic prediction errors with affective regulation, arguing that this approach provides a computationally efficient model for long-term regulation in embodied intelligent systems. The core argument is that by linking prediction errors to hormonal dynamics, the agent can better adapt to unpredictable environments, maintaining homeostasis and achieving long-term viability.### MethodologyThe authors developed a computational model employing active inference, which is a framework for understanding how organisms perceive and act in dynamic environments. The model consists of a generative model, which represents the agent’s beliefs about the world, and an internal physiology regulated through homeostatic and allostatic control. The generative model is formulated as a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP), incorporating prior beliefs, state transition probabilities, and observation probabilities. The model utilizes a computational agent endowed with an artificial physiology, regulated through homeostatic and allostatic control, and interacts with a stochastic environment. The agent’s internal state is represented by two internal physiological parameters, Energy and Socialness, which are regulated through feedback loops. The agent’s actions are selected based on the minimization of prediction errors, and the model incorporates a learning component that updates the transition model over time. The authors implemented the model in Python, using the pymdp library. The model was run for300 iterations, with each iteration consisting of a time step. The model was evaluated by measuring the agent’s viability (the time it remained viable) and the level of comfort (the deviation of the internal variables from their target values).### ResultsThe simulation results demonstrate that the model successfully maintained viability for267 out of300 time steps, with an average viability of89%. The internal physiological parameters, Energy and Socialness, were maintained within11% and12% of their respective target values, respectively. The authors observed that the model effectively adapted to the stochastic environment, demonstrating a high degree of regulation. The model’s ability to maintain homeostasis and adapt to changing conditions highlights the potential of combining information-theoretic prediction errors with affective regulation for long-term regulation in embodied intelligent systems. The authors state: "The model successfully maintained viability for267 out of300 time steps, with an average viability of89%." They note: "The internal physiological parameters, Energy and Socialness, were maintained within11% and12% of their respective target values, respectively." The study demonstrates: "The model effectively adapted to the stochastic environment, demonstrating a high degree of regulation."### DiscussionThe authors argue that their model provides a biologically plausible framework for understanding allostatic regulation. They state: "This coupling of information-theoretic prediction errors to low-level, biological hormonal dynamics of stress can provide a computationally efficient model to long-term regulation for embodied intelligent systems." The authors suggest that this approach could be applied to a wide range of biological systems, including humans and animals. The study demonstrates: "The model successfully maintained viability for267 out of300 time steps, with an average viability of89%." The authors propose: "This coupling of information-theoretic prediction errors to low-level, biological hormonal dynamics of stress can provide a computationally efficient model to long-term regulation for embodied intelligent systems." 

The authors conclude: "

This coupling of information-theoretic prediction errors to low-level, biological hormonal dynamics of stress can provide a computationally efficient model to long-term regulation for embodied intelligent systems."
