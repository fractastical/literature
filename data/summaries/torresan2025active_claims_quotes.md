Okay, here’s an extraction of key claims, hypotheses, findings, and important quotes from the provided research paper. I’ve followed all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **The Core Hypothesis:** The paper investigates whether an agent learning to navigate a grid-world environment can achieve better performance when using a more accurate model of the environment (action-aware) compared to a simpler model (action-unaware).

2. **Bayesian Inference as a Core Mechanism:** The paper posits that Bayesian inference plays a crucial role in the agent’s learning process, allowing it to better estimate the probabilities of different actions and states.

3. **The Importance of Accurate Models:** The research suggests that a more accurate model of the environment leads to improved learning and decision-making in the agent.

4. **The Role of the Policy-Space:** The paper suggests that the agent’s policy-space is a key factor in determining the quality of its learned policy.
