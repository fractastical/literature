Okay, let's begin the extraction process according to the detailed requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Main Claim:** The paper proposes a new model for knowledge generation using active inference, capable of generating declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge simultaneously.
2.  **Hypothesis:** The model, based on the free energy principle, can effectively address the limitations of existing models in generating diverse types of knowledge.
3.  **Finding:** The model utilizes sensory stimuli to generate concepts, integrating information from perception and action.
4.  **Finding:** The model’s generative process relies on Bayesian inference and Markovian processes, allowing for dynamic updates based on observed data.
5.  **Finding:** The model’s ability to generate knowledge is dependent on the interplay between the agent’s internal states and the environment, governed by minimizing free energy.
6.  **Finding:** The model’s key component is the concept generation, which is based on the distribution of concepts and stimuli.
