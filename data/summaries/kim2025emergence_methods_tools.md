## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle posits that an agent can learn to perceive and act by minimizing the ‘surprise’ induced by sensory inputs (Friston, 2010). This surprise refers to the prediction error that arises when the agent encounters unexpected sensory observations, and reducing this surprise becomes the agent’s primary objective.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference, which combines the free energy principle with a variational approach to approximate the posterior distribution over hidden states.”
