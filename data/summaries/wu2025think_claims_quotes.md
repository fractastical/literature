Okay, let's begin extracting the key claims and quotes from the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Core Claim:** The paper proposes a novel communication-free active inference framework (AIM) to model teammates’ decision-making processes in decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), addressing the limitations of communication-based approaches.

2. **Hypothesis:** By constructing teammates’ perception-belief-action models locally, AIM can enable agents to understand teammates’ decisions without relying on explicit communication, leading to improved collaboration.

3. **Key Finding:** AIM demonstrates superior performance compared to communication-based methods across several MARL benchmarks (SMAC, SMACv2, MPE, GRF), indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

4. **Claim Regarding Methodology:** The framework utilizes a dual-filter mechanism to selectively integrate teammates’ belief portraits, mitigating the impact of inaccurate or redundant information.

5. **Claim Regarding Active Inference:** The core of AIM is based on active inference theory, modeling teammates’ decision-making as a process of perceiving the environment, forming beliefs, and taking actions.
