### OverviewThis paper investigates the design of synthetic active inference agents for use on edge devices. The authors state: “The theoretical properties of active inference agents are impressive, but how do we realize effective agents in working hardware and software on edge devices?” They note: “a high-quality AIF software toolbox is needed to realize the proposition in [11].” The authors argue: “The number of applications for autonomous AIF agents is expected to vastly outgrow the number of world-class experts in AIF and robotics.” The study demonstrates: “reactive message passing” as a key approach to AIF agent design.### MethodologyThe authors propose a toolbox-in-progress to accelerate the democratization of active inference agents. They state: “The authors note that the steep rise of commercialization opportunities for deep learning systems was greatly facilitated by the availability of professional-leveltoolboxessuchasTensorFlowandsuccessors.” The toolbox is based on message passing in a factor graph, which is described as: “a reactive programming-based implementation of message passing will be the standard in professional-levelAIFtools.” The authors claim: “The authors state that the computational load for policy exploration explodes exponentially, while the computational resources are very limited for edge devices.” The toolbox supports the development of AIF agents by enabling competent engineers to define sub-tasks and solve these tasks autonomously. The authors note: “The authors state that the robot should be able to define sub-tasks and solve these tasks autonomously.” The study demonstrates: “reactive message passing” as a key approach to AIF agent design. The authors argue: “The authors state that the robot should be able to perform robustly, in real-time, and cleverly manage the consumption of its computational resources.” All these robot properties should be supported seamlessly by Sarah’s AIF software toolbox. For instance, she should not need to know the specifics of how to implement robustness in her algorithms or how many time steps the robotneedstolookaheadinanygivensituationforeffectiveplanningpurposes.### ResultsThe authors present a toolbox-in-progress that aims to accelerate the democratization of active inference agents. The authors argue: “The authors state that the robot should be able to perform robustly, in real-time, and cleverly manage the consumption of its computational resources.”### DiscussionThe authors propose a toolbox-in-progress to accelerate the democratization of active inference agents. Along with [11], we think that the potential benefits of shared intelligence in ecosystems of communicating AIF agents are hard to overstate. 

As we have argued in this position paper, the required underlying technology for realizing this vision is very demanding and currently not yet available. 

Still, we also think it is not out of reach and is one of the most exciting ongoing research threads in the AI field.
