Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The Free Energy Principle states that intelligent systems self-organize into coherent, stable structures by minimizing a free energy functional.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active Inference (AIF) is a specific approach to modelling intelligent agents that focuses on planning for the future.”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “AIF relies on variational inference techniques to minimise a free energy functional.”
*   Mean Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “The mean field approximation is used to simplify the problem by assuming that each variable is independent of all other variables.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The algorithm uses gradient descent to optimise the free energy functional.”
*   Bayesian Filtering (exact quote from paper) – “The algorithm uses Bayesian filtering to estimate the state of the system.”
*   Expectation Propagation (exact quote from paper) – “EP is used to approximate the posterior distribution.”
*   Laplacian Eigenmaps (exact quote from paper) – “Laplacian Eigenmaps is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data.”
*   Bethe Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – “The Bethe free energy is a measure of the energy of a system.”
*   Forney-style factor graphs (exact quote from paper) – “FFGs are used to represent generative models.”
*   Constrained Forney-style factor graphs (exact quote from paper) – “CFFGs are used to represent generative models with constraints.”
*   LagrangianActiveInference (LAIF) (exact quote from paper) – “LAIF is a method for solving AIF problems using a Lagrangian.”
*   Mean Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “The mean field approximation is used to simplify the problem by assuming that each variable is independent of all other variables.”
