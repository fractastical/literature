Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a novel approach to learning state spaces, likelihood, and transition dynamics using tensor networks, aiming to represent generative models for active inference.
2.  The core hypothesis is that tensor networks, due to their ability to represent probabilistic states and reduce dimensionality, are a natural candidate for generative modeling and active inference.
3.  The paper’s central claim is that tensor networks can be used to represent generative models of sequential data and obtain beliefs (probabilities) about observations directly from the model.
4.  The authors hypothesize that the sophisticated active inference scheme can be implemented using tensor networks, allowing for the computation of the expected free energy.
5.  A key claim is that the method demonstrates the ability to plan with active inference, utilizing the learned model to make decisions and achieve desired outcomes.
