Okay, here’s the extracted information from the research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The paper proposes the “e-person architecture” as a unified approach to AI ethics, based on reducing uncertainty through collaborative cognition and action.
2.  The core hypothesis is that a system can be built that addresses ethical issues in AI by treating uncertainty as a fundamental cognitive process, mirroring the brain’s function.
3.  The paper posits that AI ethics should be viewed as a co-construction between humans and AI, rather than a unidirectional imposition of rules by AI.
4.  The research aims to develop a framework for AI systems that incorporates a multi-layered understanding of uncertainty, categorized by perspective (first-person, second-person, third-person) and depth of information.
5.  The authors hypothesize that by modeling uncertainty in a way that aligns with the free energy principle, AI systems can achieve a more robust and adaptable approach to ethical decision-making.
