## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The FEP aims to describe the physical properties of a system in terms of dynamics on a manifold of probability distributions (i.e., as variational inference) – "The FEP aims to describe the physical properties of a system in terms of dynamics on a manifold of probability distributions (i.e., as variational inference)"
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "The system dynamics are characterised by a gradient flow on the variational free energy"
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference”
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP applies to generative models that contain a partition of the states or paths of a joint system (a so called “particular” partition, i.e., into objects or particles)”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "We will make a more general case for its utility in statistical mechanics at large. After reviewing prior work on the FEP, we identify a particular issue that the FEP is able to uniquely address: the FEP keeps track of how a model depends on aspects of the thing that is modelled in a particularly insightful way, offering advantages in terms of tractability and explanation, by using gradients of variational free energy to describe the dynamics of interacting systems."
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “We will make a more general case for its utility in statistical mechanics at large.

## Datasets

*   Cellular morphogenesis (exact quote from paper) – “We will use a dataset of cells”
*   Periodically-firing cells (exact quote from paper) – “We will use a dataset of cells”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “We will make a more general case for its utility in statistical mechanics at large.

## Summary

The paper utilizes the Free Energy Principle, gradient descent, and Bayesian inference, primarily implemented using PyTorch and Google Colab. The evaluation relies on t-tests and ANOVA, and the datasets are cellular morphogenesis and periodically-firing cells.
