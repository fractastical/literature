Okay, let's begin. Here’s the extracted information from the paper, adhering to the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that any self-organizing system, regardless of its complexity, can be interpreted as performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environment.
2.  A core assumption of the FEP is that systems will evolve to minimize a variational free energy, driven by the need to maintain themselves in a low-entropy configuration.
3.  The FEP proposes that systems with a Markov blanket – a statistical separation between internal and external states – can be described as performing Bayesian inference.
4.  The FEP suggests that the dynamics of a system can be described by a gradient of a variational free energy, linked to the average flow of the system.
5.  The FEP claims that the most likely states of a system can be described by a conditional synchronization manifold.

"The FEP assumes that the system will reach a non-equilibrium steady state described by the probability density function p(z ), which can be described using a SDE decomposition that separates the flow into dissipative ( Γ J(z )) and solenoidal (Q J(z )) components." (Authors, Introduction)
