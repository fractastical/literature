Okay, here’s the extracted information from the paper, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The AIC suffers from a biased state estimation:** The authors state: "…the AIC has a biased estimate of the state, and only an implicit model of control actions.” This bias arises from the goal prior, leading to reduced quality in state estimation and influencing learning.

2.  **The AIC’s control action is not explicitly modeled:** According to the paper, “the control action is not explicitly modeled as a random variable in the generative model.” This lack of explicit modeling causes issues on the control side.

3.  **The u-AIC addresses these limitations:** The authors state: “we propose an extended and improved unbiased AIC (u-AIC)…”. The u-AIC aims to remove these limitations.

4.  **Convergence is achieved with the u-AIC:** The authors state: “proof of convergence for both the state estimation and the control”.

5.  **The u-AIC extends the AIC with new control architecture:** The authors state: “1) a derivation of the new control architecture and possible extensions, 2) a proof of convergence for both the state estimation and the control”.
