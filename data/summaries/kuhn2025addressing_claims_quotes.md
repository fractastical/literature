Okay, let's begin extracting the key claims and important quotes from the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The Subsumption Thesis:** The paper’s central claim is that expected utility theory, as commonly applied in economics, is subsumed by active inference. This means that active inference provides a more fundamental account of agency than traditional expected utility models.
2.  **Formal Bridge Proposal:** The paper proposes to establish a formal bridge between microeconomics and active inference, offering a new framework for understanding agent-environment interactions.
3.  **ITBR as a Key Component:** The paper argues that Information-Theoretic Bounded Rationality (ITBR) is crucial for this formal bridge, providing a way to constrain expected utility models and align them with active inference.
4.  **POMDPs as a Testbed:** The paper utilizes Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) as a framework for evaluating the relationship between expected utility and active inference.
5.  **Differing Agency Accounts:** The paper posits that expected utility and active inference represent fundamentally different accounts of agency, with active inference offering a more biologically plausible model.
6.  **Hypothesis: Active Inference is More Accurate:** The paper’s core hypothesis is that active inference provides a more accurate description of how agents actually make decisions, particularly in complex environments.

## Important Quotes

1.  “As a unified theory of sentient behaviour, active inference is formally intertwined with multiple normative theories of optimal behaviour.” (The authors state: "As a unified theory of sentient behaviour, active inference is formally intertwined with multiple normative theories of optimal behaviour.") - *This quote establishes the overarching goal of the paper.*
2.  “Theclaimthatexpectedutilityfromeconomics,asanaccountofagency,is subsumed by active inference.” (The authors state: "The claim that expected utility from economics, as an account of agency, is subsumed by active inference.") - *This is the core claim of the paper.*
3.  “Toformallycomparethetwoaccountsofagency,werequireacommensurable spaceforagent-environmentinteractions:MDPsandPOMDPs(Definition1and 2).” (The authors state: "To formally compare the two accounts of agency, we require a commensurable space for agent-environment interactions: MDPs and POMDPs (Definition 1 and 2).") - *This highlights the methodological approach.*
4.  “Theagenttakestheactiontrajectoryπ ={a ,...,a }thatminimizesthecumulative expected free energy G, which is the sum of the single-step EFE” (The authors state: "The agent takes the action trajectory π = {a ,..., a } that minimizes the cumulative expected free energy G, which is the sum of the single-step EFE.") - *This describes the core objective function of active inference.*
9.  “Toformallycomparethetwoaccountsofagency,werequireacommensurable spaceforagent-environmentinteractions:MDPsandPOMDPs(Definition1and 2).” (The authors state: "To formally compare the two accounts of agency, we require a commensurable space for agent-environment interactions: MDPs and POMDPs (Definition 1 and 2).") - *This highlights the methodological approach.*
