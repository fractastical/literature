      "abstract": "In this PhD thesis, we explore and apply methods inspired by the free energy principle to two important areas in machine learning and neuroscience. The free energy principle is a general mathematical theory of the necessary information-theoretic behaviours of systems that maintain a separation from their environment. A core postulate of the theory is that complex systems can be seen as performing variational Bayesian inference and minimizing an information-theoretic quantity called the variational free energy. The thesis is structured into three independent sections. Firstly, we focus on predictive coding, a neurobiologically plausible process theory derived from the free energy principle which argues that the primary function of the brain is to minimize prediction errors, showing how predictive coding can be scaled up and extended to be more biologically plausible, and elucidating its close links with other methods such as Kalman Filtering. Secondly, we study active inference, a neurobiologically grounded account of action through variational message passing, and investigate how these methods can be scaled up to match the performance of deep reinforcement learning methods. We additionally provide a detailed mathematical understanding of the nature and origin of the information-theoretic objectives that underlie exploratory behaviour. Finally, we investigate biologically plausible methods of credit assignment in the brain. We first demonstrate a close link between predictive coding and the backpropagation of error algorithm. We go on to propose novel and simpler algorithms which allow for backprop to be implemented in purely local, biologically plausible computations.",

      "abstract": "Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off \"leaky\" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remains elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and allatom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have predicted the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and suggested the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.",

Judging by the amount of attention it has received from the scientific community, the FEP has gained significant traction in these pursuits. The current target article represents an important iteration of this research paradigm in formally describing emergent dynamics rather than merely (quasi-)steady states. This affords more in-depth considerations of the spatio-temporal complexities of cross-scale causality - as we have encouraged and built towards in previous publications (e.g., [4-9]).

      "abstract": "Despite their groundbreaking performance, autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail. This milestone may inspire both deployments in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for an explanation of how natural agents -- with little or no training -- survive in capricious environments.",

      "abstract": "Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) remains unresolved, particularly with respect to how integrated information, proposed as the intrinsic substrate of consciousness, behaves within variational Bayesian inference. We investigated this issue using dissociated neuronal cultures, previously shown to perform perceptual inference consistent with the FEP. Repeated stimulation from hidden sources induced robust source selectivity: variational free energy (VFE) decreased across sessions, whereas accuracy and Bayesian surprise (complexity) increased. Network-level analyses revealed that a proxy measure of integrated information and the size of the main complex followed a hill-shaped trajectory, with informational cores organizing diverse neuronal activity. Across experiments, integrated information correlated strongly and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and showed no significant relationship with VFE. The positive coupling between Φ and Bayesian surprise likely reflects the diversity of activity observed in critical dynamics. These findings suggest that integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency. The hill-shaped trajectory of Φ during inference can be functionally interpreted as a transition from exploration to exploitation. This work provides empirical evidence linking the physical account of consciousness advanced by IIT with the functional perspective offered by the FEP, contributing to a unified framework for the mechanisms and adaptive roles of phenomenology.",

A general framework for thinking about resilience in this context will be sketched out and some models will be provided using that framework.",

It demonstrates that active inference dynamics, including the minimization of variational and expected free energy, naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the Free Energy Principle.

      "abstract": "Free energy principle (FEP) is a burgeoning theory in theoretical neuroscience that provides a universal law for modelling living systems of any scale. Expecting a digital twin mind from this first principle, we propose a macro-level interpretation that bridge neuroscience and psychoanalysis through the lens of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis. In this article, we claim three fundamental parallels between FEP and Lacanian psychoanalysis, and suggest a FEP approach to formalizing Lacan's theory. Sharing the non-linear temporal structure that combines prediction and retrospection (logical time), both of two theories focus on epistemological questions that how systems represented themselves and external world, and those elements failed to be represented (lacks and free energy) significantly influence the systems' subsequent states. Additionally, the fundamental hypothesis of FEP that the precise state of environment is always concealed, accounts for object petit a, the core concept in Lacan's theory. With neuropsychoanalytic mapping from three orders (the Real, the Symbolic, and the Imaginary, RSI) onto brain regions, we propose a brain-wide FEP model for a minimal definition of Lacanian mind - composite state of RSI that is perturbated by desire running over the logical time. The FEP-RSI model involves three FEP units connected by respective free energy with a natural compliance with logical time, mimicking core dynamics of Lacanian mind. The biological plausibility of current model is considered from perspectives of cognitive neuroscience. In conclusion, the FEP-RSI model encapsulates a unified framework for digital twin modeling at the macro level.",

In this paper, we continue to finesse the FEP through the physics-guided formulation; specifically, we apply our theory to synaptic learning by considering it an inference problem under the FEP and derive the governing equations, called Bayesian mechanics. Our study uncovers how the brain infers weight change and postsynaptic activity, conditioned on the presynaptic input, by deploying the generative models of the likelihood and prior belief.

In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed, to cast the emergence of subjective temporality, along with a Bayesian mechanism for hierarchical duration estimation, from first principles of the physics of self-organization. Using active inference, a deep parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described dynamics on a computational level. Two biases (i.e. variations) of time-perception naturally emerge from the simulated computational model. This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e. the compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences) and empirically documented alterations of subjective time experience in deep states of meditative absorption (i.e. in minimal phenomenal experience). Generally, numerous systematic and domain-specific alterations of subjective temporal experience are computationally explained in a unified manner, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the respective domains. This concerns - next to more general scale-invariant effects of explicit timing and central tendency effects - the temporality-modulating role of valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-states, near death-experiences, and various psychopathologies, amongst others. The self-simulational theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the subjective temporal Now emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes, subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities; with the computational mechanism being readily deployable synthetically.",

The contributions are threefold: 1) We compute the entropy production for a greater class of systems than before, including almost any stationary diffusion process, such as degenerate diffusions where the driving noise does not act on all coordinates of the system. Importantly, this class of systems encompasses Markovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and meso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a Bayesian mechanics for biological and physical entities that interact with their environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the internal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with variational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3) We refine the constraints on Bayesian mechanics to obtain a description that is more specific to biological systems, called the free-energy principle. This says that active and internal states of biological systems unfold as minimising a quantity known as free energy. The mathematical foundation to the free-energy principle, presented here, unlocks a first principles approach to modeling and simulating behavior in neurobiology and artificial intelligence, by minimising free energy given a generative model of external and sensory states.",

      "abstract": "In Reinforcement Learning (RL), artificial agents are trained to maximize numerical rewards by performing tasks. Exploration is essential in RL because agents must discover information before exploiting it. Two rewards encouraging efficient exploration are the entropy of action policy and curiosity for information gain. Entropy is well-established in literature, promoting randomized action selection. Curiosity is defined in a broad variety of ways in literature, promoting discovery of novel experiences. One example, prediction error curiosity, rewards agents for discovering observations they cannot accurately predict. However, such agents may be distracted by unpredictable observational noises known as curiosity traps. Based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP), this paper proposes hidden state curiosity, which rewards agents by the KL divergence between the predictive prior and posterior probabilities of latent variables. We trained six types of agents to navigate mazes: baseline agents without rewards for entropy or curiosity, and agents rewarded for entropy and/or either prediction error curiosity or hidden state curiosity. We find entropy and curiosity result in efficient exploration, especially both employed together. Notably, agents with hidden state curiosity demonstrate resilience against curiosity traps, which hinder agents with prediction error curiosity. This suggests implementing the FEP may enhance the robustness and generalization of RL models, potentially aligning the learning processes of artificial and biological agents.",

      "abstract": "A numerical model of interacting nanomagnetic elements is used to demonstrate active inference with a three dimensional Artificial Spin Ice structure. It is shown that thermal fluctuations can drive this magnetic spin system to evolve under dynamic constraints imposed through interactions with an external environment as predicted by the neurological free energy principle and active inference. The structure is defined by two layers of magnetic nanoelements where one layer is a square Artificial Spin Ice geometry. The other magnetic layer functions as a sensory filter that mediates interaction between the external environment and the hidden Artificial Spin Ice layer. Spin dynamics displayed by the bilayer structure are shown to be well described using a continuous form of a neurological free energy principle that has been previously proposed as a high level description of certain biological neural processes. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this proposed bilayer geometry is able to reproduce theoretical results derived previously for examples of active inference in neurological contexts.",

It rehearses the key steps using standard results from statistical physics. These steps entail (i) establishing a particular partition of states based upon conditional independencies that inherit from sparsely coupled dynamics, (ii) unpacking the implications of this partition in terms of Bayesian inference and (iii) describing the paths of particular states with a variational principle of least action. Teleologically, the free energy principle offers a normative account of self-organisation in terms of optimal Bayesian design and decision-making, in the sense of maximising marginal likelihood or Bayesian model evidence. In summary, starting from a description of the world in terms of random dynamical systems, we end up with a description of self-organisation as sentient behaviour that can be interpreted as self-evidencing; namely, self-assembly, autopoiesis or active inference.",

Such hierarchies occur throughout biology, from the architectures of intracellular signal transduction pathways to the large-scale organization of perception and action cycles in the mammalian brain.

I go on to conjecture that a path-based formulation of the FEP has key features which restore its explanatory power in broad physical regimes.

The authors demonstrate that in general, Markov blankets are not guaranteed to follow from sparse coupling. The current commentary explains the relationship between sparse coupling and Markov blankets in the case of Gaussian steady-state densities. We precisely derive conditions under which causal coupling leads--or does not lead--to Markov blankets. Importantly, our derivations hold for both linear and non-linear stochastic differential equations. This result may shed light on the sorts of systems which we expect to have Markov blankets. Future work should focus on verifying whether these sorts of constraints are satisfied in realistic models of sparsely coupled systems.",

This analysis sheds new light on previous claims made in the FEP literature (and contested in the target article) that the internal dynamics of stochastic systems can be cast performing a gradient flow on variational free energy, and thus endowed with an inferential interpretation, i.e., as if internal states are performing inference about states external to the system. I express general agreement with the target article's statement that the marginal flow of internal states does not point along variational free energy gradients evaluated at the most likely internal state (i.e., the conditional mode). However, in this commentary I focus on the flow of particular states (internal and blanket states) and their variational free energy gradients, and show that for a wide but restricted class of solenoidal couplings, the average flow of these systems point along variational free energy gradients. This licenses a different but perhaps stronger re-description of the flow of particular states as performing inference, which importantly holds at arbitrary points in state space, not just at the conditional modes.",

Both critical points of Bethe-Kikuchi functionals and stationary beliefs are shown to lie at the non-linear intersection of two constraint surfaces, enforcing energy conservation and marginal consistency respectively. The hypersurface of singular beliefs, accross which equilibria become unstable as the constraint surfaces meet tangentially, is described by polynomial equations in the convex polytope of consistent beliefs. This polynomial is expressed by a loop series expansion for graphs of binary variables.",

Our experimental results indicated that (1) the human experimenter needs more/less force to induce trained transitions when $w$ is set with larger/smaller values, (2) the human experimenter needs more force to act on the robot when he attempts to induce untrained as opposed to trained movement pattern transitions.

      "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP), as an encompassing framework and a unified brain theory, has been widely applied to account for various problems in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, social interaction, and hermeneutics. As a computational model deeply rooted in math and statistics, FEP posits an optimization problem based on variational Bayes, which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice. However, there seems to be a bottleneck in extending the FEP to machine learning and implementing such models with neural networks. This paper gives a preliminary attempt at bridging FEP and machine learning, via a classical neural network model, the Helmholtz machine. As a variational machine learning model, the Helmholtz machine is optimized by minimizing its free energy, the same objective as FEP. Although the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it gives an ideal parallel to the vanilla FEP and the hierarchical model of the brain, under which the active inference and predictive coding could be formulated coherently. Besides a detailed theoretical discussion, the paper also presents a preliminary experiment to validate the hypothesis. By fine-tuning the trained neural network through active inference, the model performance is promoted to accuracy above 99\\%. In the meantime, the data distribution is continuously deformed to a salience that conforms to the model representation, as a result of active sampling.",

This upper bound can be read as a Bayesian prediction error. Equivalently, its negative is a lower bound on Bayesian model evidence (a.k.a., marginal likelihood). In short, certain random dynamical systems evince a kind of self-evidencing. Here, we reformulate the FEP in the formal setting of spacetime-background free, scale-free quantum information theory. We show how generic quantum systems can be regarded as observers, which with the standard freedom of choice assumption become agents capable of assigning semantics to observational outcomes. We show how such agents minimize Bayesian prediction error in environments characterized by uncertainty, insufficient learning, and quantum contextuality. We show that in its quantum-theoretic formulation, the FEP is asymptotically equivalent to the Principle of Unitarity. Based on these results, we suggest that biological systems employ quantum coherence as a computational resource and - implicitly - as a communication resource. We summarize a number of problems for future research, particularly involving the resources required for classical communication and for detecting and responding to quantum context switches.",

In this work, we examine in depth the assumptions required to derive the FEP in the simplest possible set of systems -- weakly-coupled non-equilibrium linear stochastic systems. Specifically, we explore (i) how general the requirements imposed on the statistical structure of a system are and (ii) how informative the FEP is about the behaviour of such systems. We discover that two requirements of the FEP -- the Markov blanket condition (i.e. a statistical boundary precluding direct coupling between internal and external states) and stringent restrictions on its solenoidal flows (i.e. tendencies driving a system out of equilibrium) -- are only valid for a very narrow space of parameters. Suitable systems require an absence of perception-action asymmetries that is highly unusual for living systems interacting with an environment. More importantly, we observe that a mathematically central step in the argument, connecting the behaviour of a system to variational inference, relies on an implicit equivalence between the dynamics of the average states of a system with the average of the dynamics of those states. This equivalence does not hold in general even for linear systems, since it requires an effective decoupling from the system's history of interactions. These observations are critical for evaluating the generality and applicability of the FEP and indicate the existence of significant problems of the theory in its current form. These issues make the FEP, as it stands, not straightforwardly applicable to the simple linear systems studied here and suggest that more development is needed before the theory could be applied to the kind of complex systems that describe living and cognitive processes.",

      "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP) from neuroscience provides a framework called active inference for the joint estimation and control of state space systems, subjected to colored noise. However, the active inference community has been challenged with the critical task of manually tuning the noise smoothness parameter. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel online noise smoothness estimator based on the idea of free energy principle. We mathematically show that our estimator can converge to the free energy optimum during smoothness estimation. Using this formulation, we introduce a joint state and noise smoothness observer design called DEMs. Through rigorous simulations, we show that DEMs outperforms state-of-the-art state observers with least state estimation error. Finally, we provide a proof of concept for DEMs by applying it on a real life robotics problem - state estimation of a quadrotor hovering in wind, demonstrating its practical use.",

We claim that these are used in the service of active inference in accord with the free-energy principle (FEP). While conceptual advances alongside modelling and simulation work have attempted to connect speech segmentation and linguistic communication with the FEP, we extend this program to the underlying computations responsible for generating syntactic objects. We argue that recently proposed principles of economy in language design - such as \"minimal search\" criteria from theoretical syntax - adhere to the FEP. This affords a greater degree of explanatory power to the FEP - with respect to higher language functions - and offers linguistics a grounding in first principles with respect to computability. We show how both tree-geometric depth and a Kolmogorov complexity estimate (recruiting a Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm) can be used to accurately predict legal operations on syntactic workspaces, directly in line with formulations of variational free energy minimization. This is used to motivate a general principle of language design that we term Turing-Chomsky Compression (TCC). We use TCC to align concerns of linguists with the normative account of self-organization furnished by the FEP, by marshalling evidence from theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics to ground core principles of efficient syntactic computation within active inference.",

Gibbs states are simultaneously characterized by free energy principles and the max-entropy principle, with dual constraints on inverse temperature $β$ and mean energy ${\\cal U}(β) = \\mathbb{E}_{ρ^β}[H]$ respectively. The Legendre transform relates these diverse variational principles which are unfortunately not tractable in high dimension.

We show that the generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithm solves a collection of local variational principles, by converging to critical points of Bethe-Kikuchi approximations of the free energy $F(β)$, the Shannon entropy $S(\\cal U)$, and the variational free energy ${\\cal F}(β) = {\\cal U} - β^{-1} S(\\cal U)$, extending an initial correspondence by Yedidia et al.

Although the FEP has successfully described a rule that living things obey mathematically and claims that a biological system continues to change its internal models and behaviors to minimize the difference in predicting sensory input, it is not enough to model sensorimotor visual perception. An embodiment of the system is the key to achieving sensorimotor visual perception. The proposed embodied system is configured by a body and memory. The body has an ocular motor system controlling the direction of eye gaze, which means that the eye can only observe a small focused area of the environment. The memory is not photographic, but is a generative model implemented with a variational autoencoder that contains prior knowledge about the environment, and that knowledge is classified. By limiting body and memory abilities and operating according to the FEP, the embodied system repeatedly takes action to obtain the next sensory input based on various potentials of future sensory inputs. In the evaluation, the inference of the environment was represented as an approximate posterior distribution of characters (0 - 9). As the number of repetitions increased, the attention area moved continuously, gradually reducing the uncertainty of characters. Finally, the probability of the correct character became the highest among the characters. Changing the initial attention position provides a different final distribution, suggesting that the proposed system has a confirmation bias.",

We focus on non-realist (deflationary and fictionalist-instrumentalist) approaches. We consider a deflationary account of mental representation, according to which the explanatorily relevant contents of neural representations are mathematical, rather than cognitive, and a fictionalist or instrumentalist account, according to which representations are scientifically useful fictions that serve explanatory (and other) aims. After reviewing the free-energy principle and active inference, we argue that the model of adaptive phenotypes under the free-energy principle can be used to furnish a formal semantics, enabling us to assign semantic content to specific phenotypic states (the internal states of a Markovian system that exists far from equilibrium). We propose a modified fictionalist account: an organism-centered fictionalism or instrumentalism. We argue that, under the free-energy principle, pursuing even a deflationary account of the content of neural representations licenses the appeal to the kind of semantic content involved in the aboutness or intentionality of cognitive systems; our position is thus coherent with, but rests on distinct assumptions from, the realist position. We argue that the free-energy principle thereby explains the aboutness or intentionality in living systems and hence their capacity to parse their sensory stream using an ontology or set of semantic factors.",

Imitation Learning (IL) can learn from expert demonstrations without exploration, but it never exceeds the expert's performance and is also vulnerable to distributional shift between demonstration and execution. In this paper, we radically unify RL and IL based on Free Energy Principle (FEP). FEP is a unified Bayesian theory of the brain that explains perception, action and model learning by a common fundamental principle. We present a theoretical extension of FEP and derive an algorithm in which an agent learns the world model that internalizes expert demonstrations and at the same time uses the model to infer the current and future states and actions that maximize rewards. The algorithm thus reduces exploration costs by partially imitating experts as well as maximizing its return in a seamless way, resulting in a higher performance than the suboptimal expert. Our experimental results show that this approach is promising in visual control tasks especially in sparse-reward environments.",

This principle provides insights on multiple scales, from high-level behavioral and cognitive functions such as attention or foraging, down to the dynamics of specialized cortical microcircuits, suggesting that the FEP manifests on several levels of brain function. Here, we apply the FEP to one of the smallest functional units of the brain: single excitatory synaptic connections. By focusing on an experimentally well understood biological system we are able to derive learning rules from first principles while keeping assumptions minimal. This synapse-centric account of the FEP predicts that synapses interact with the soma of the post-synaptic neuron through stochastic synaptic releases to probe their behavior and use back-propagating action potentials as feedback to update the synaptic weights. The emergent learning rules are regulated triplet STDP rules that depend only on the timing of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes and the internal states of the synapse. The parameters of the learning rules are fully determined by the parameters of the post-synaptic neuron model, suggesting a close interplay between the synaptic and somatic compartment and making precise predictions about the synaptic dynamics. The synapse-level uncertainties automatically lead to representations of uncertainty on the network level that manifest in ambiguous situations. We show that the FEP learning rules can be applied to spiking neural networks for supervised and unsupervised learning and for a closed loop learning task where a behaving agent interacts with an environment.",

Specifically, it claims that any self-organizing system which can be statistically separated from its environment, and which maintains itself at a non-equilibrium steady state, can be construed as minimizing an information-theoretic functional -- the variational free energy -- and thus performing variational Bayesian inference to infer the hidden state of its environment. This principle has also been applied extensively in neuroscience, and is beginning to make inroads in machine learning by spurring the construction of novel and powerful algorithms by which action, perception, and learning can all be unified under a single objective. While its expansive and often grandiose claims have spurred significant debates in both philosophy and theoretical neuroscience, the mathematical depth and lack of accessible introductions and tutorials for the core claims of the theory have often precluded a deep understanding within the literature. Here, we aim to provide a mathematically detailed, yet intuitive walk-through of the formulation and central claims of the FEP while also providing a discussion of the assumptions necessary and potential limitations of the theory. Additionally, since the FEP is a still a living theory, subject to internal controversy, change, and revision, we also present a detailed appendix highlighting and condensing current perspectives as well as controversies about the nature, applicability, and the mathematical assumptions and formalisms underlying the FEP.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to leverage the free-energy principle and its corollary process theory, active inference, to develop a generic, generalizable model of the representational capacities of living creatures; that is, a theory of phenotypic representation. Given their ubiquity, we are concerned with distributed forms of representation (e.g., population codes), whereby patterns of ensemble activity in living tissue come to represent the causes of sensory input or data. The active inference framework rests on the Markov blanket formalism, which allows us to partition systems of interest, such as biological systems, into internal states, external states, and the blanket (active and sensory) states that render internal and external states conditionally independent of each other. In this framework, the representational capacity of living creatures emerges as a consequence of their Markovian structure and nonequilibrium dynamics, which together entail a dual-aspect information geometry. This entails a modest representational capacity: internal states have an intrinsic information geometry that describes their trajectory over time in state space, as well as an extrinsic information geometry that allows internal states to encode (the parameters of) probabilistic beliefs about (fictive) external states. Building on this, we describe here how, in an automatic and emergent manner, information about stimuli can come to be encoded by groups of neurons bound by a Markov blanket; what is known as the neuronal packet hypothesis. As a concrete demonstration of this type of emergent representation, we present numerical simulations showing that self-organizing ensembles of active inference agents sharing the right kind of probabilistic generative model are able to encode recoverable information about a stimulus array.",

      "abstract": "The free energy functional has recently been proposed as a variational principle for bounded rational decision-making, since it instantiates a natural trade-off between utility gains and information processing costs that can be axiomatically derived. Here we apply the free energy principle to general decision trees that include both adversarial and stochastic environments. We derive generalized sequential optimality equations that not only include the Bellman optimality equations as a limit case, but also lead to well-known decision-rules such as Expectimax, Minimax and Expectiminimax. We show how these decision-rules can be derived from a single free energy principle that assigns a resource parameter to each node in the decision tree. These resource parameters express a concrete computational cost that can be measured as the amount of samples that are needed from the distribution that belongs to each node. The free energy principle therefore provides the normative basis for generalized optimality equations that account for both adversarial and stochastic environments.",

The free energy principle is accordingly rephrased as that for autopoietic grounds all viable organisms attempt to minimize the sensory uncertainty about the unpredictable environment over a temporal horizon. By varying the informational action, we derive the brain's recognition dynamics (RD) which conducts Bayesian filtering of the external causes from noisy sensory inputs. Consequently, we effectively cast the gradient-descent scheme of minimizing the free energy into Hamiltonian mechanics by addressing only positions and momenta of the organisms' representations of the causal environment. To manifest the utility of our theory, we show how the RD may be implemented in a neuronally based biophysical model at a single-cell level and subsequently in a coarse-grained, hierarchical architecture of the brain. We also present formal solutions to the RD for a model brain in linear regime and analyze the perceptual trajectories around attractors in neural state space.",

Under this principle, biological agents learn a generative model of the world and plan actions in the future that will maintain the agent in an homeostatic state that satisfies its preferences. This framework lends itself to being realized in silico, as it comprehends important aspects that make it computationally affordable, such as variational inference and amortized planning. In this work, we investigate the tool of deep learning to design and realize artificial agents based on active inference, presenting a deep-learning oriented presentation of the free energy principle, surveying works that are relevant in both machine learning and active inference areas, and discussing the design choices that are involved in the implementation process. This manuscript probes newer perspectives for the active inference framework, grounding its theoretical aspects into more pragmatic affairs, offering a practical guide to active inference newcomers and a starting point for deep learning practitioners that would like to investigate implementations of the free energy principle.",

In this basic model we will separate how we learn from Ignorance, and how we anticipate the world using Bayes formula, both should however be more entangled to best reflect reality.

The aim of this article is therefore to show, as seen from a person, another aspect of the application of the free energy principle which represents the constrained Shannon's entropy, and leads to Bayes'formula.

We discuss how these issues affect related results involving generalised coordinates and, where appropriate, mention consequences for and reveal, up to now unacknowledged, differences to newer formulations of the free energy principle. In particular, we reveal that various definitions of the \"Markov blanket\" proposed in different works are not equivalent. We show that crucial steps in the free energy argument which involve rewriting the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets, are not generally correct without additional (previously unstated) assumptions. We prove by counterexample that the original free energy lemma, when taken at face value, is wrong. We show further that this free energy lemma, when it does hold, implies equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it is not sufficiently justified. Additionally, we highlight that the variational densities presented in newer formulations of the free energy principle and lemma are parameterised by different variables than in older works, leading to a substantially different interpretation of the theory. Note that we only highlight some specific problems in the discussed publications. These problems do not rule out conclusively that the general ideas behind the free energy principle are worth pursuing.",

To that end here is a short, accessible and provocative overview of AGI. I compare definitions of intelligence, settling on intelligence in terms of adaptation and AGI as an artificial scientist. Taking my cue from Sutton's Bitter Lesson I describe two foundational tools used to build adaptive systems: search and approximation. I compare pros, cons, hybrids and architectures like o3, AlphaGo, AERA, NARS and Hyperon. I then discuss overall meta-approaches to making systems behave more intelligently. I divide them into scale-maxing, simp-maxing, w-maxing based on the Bitter Lesson, Ockham's and Bennett's Razors. These maximise resources, simplicity of form, and the weakness of constraints on functionality. I discuss examples including AIXI, the free energy principle and The Embiggening of language models. I conclude that though scale-maxed approximation dominates, AGI will be a fusion of tools and meta-approaches. The Embiggening was enabled by improvements in hardware.

This paper advocates for the latter and introduces a semantic generalization of Shannon's information theory (G theory for short). The core idea is to replace the distortion constraint with the semantic constraint, achieved by utilizing a set of truth functions as a semantic channel. These truth functions enable the expressions of semantic distortion, semantic information measures, and semantic information loss. Notably, the maximum semantic information criterion is equivalent to the maximum likelihood criterion and similar to the Regularized Least Squares criterion. This paper shows G theory's applications to daily and electronic semantic communication, machine learning, constraint control, Bayesian confirmation, portfolio theory, and information value. The improvements in machine learning methods involve multilabel learning and classification, maximum mutual information classification, mixture models, and solving latent variables. Furthermore, insights from statistical physics are discussed: Shannon information is similar to free energy; semantic information to free energy in local equilibrium systems; and information efficiency to the efficiency of free energy in performing work. The paper also proposes refining Friston's minimum free energy principle into the maximum information efficiency principle. Lastly, it compares G theory with other semantic information theories and discusses its limitation in representing the semantics of complex data.",

However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions.",

Additionally, unpredictable workloads and resource limitations lead to fluctuating performance and violated SLOs. To improve SLO compliance in DCCS, one possibility is to apply machine learning; however, the design choices are often left to the developer. To that extent, we provide a benchmark of Active Inference -- an emerging method from neuroscience -- against three established reinforcement learning algorithms (Deep Q-Network, Advantage Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization). We consider a realistic DCCS use case: an edge device running a video conferencing application alongside a WebSocket server streaming videos. Using one of the respective algorithms, we continuously monitor key performance metrics, such as latency and bandwidth usage, to dynamically adjust parameters -- including the number of streams, frame rate, and resolution -- to optimize service quality and user experience. To test algorithms' adaptability to constant system changes, we simulate dynamically changing SLOs and both instant and gradual data-shift scenarios, such as network bandwidth limitations and fluctuating device thermal states. Although the evaluated algorithms all showed advantages and limitations, our findings demonstrate that Active Inference is a promising approach for ensuring SLO compliance in DCCS, offering lower memory usage, stable CPU utilization, and fast convergence.",

This paper introduces the novel \"thoughtseed\" framework, proposing that cognition arises from the dynamic interaction of self-organizing units of embodied knowledge called \"thoughtseeds\" within the Global Workspace of consciousness. Leveraging foundational concepts from evolutionary theory, neuronal packets, and free energy principle, we propose a hierarchical model of cognitive states, comprising Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs), Knowledge Domains (KDs), the thoughtseed network, and meta-cognition. This hierarchical interplay, mediated by nested Markov blankets and reciprocal message passing, facilitates the emergence of thoughtseeds as coherent patterns of activity that guide perception, action, and learning. Thoughtseeds, posited as fundamental units of thought, compete for dominance within the Global Workspace, with the dominant thoughtseed shaping conscious experience and guiding behavior. We present a mathematical framework grounded in active inference and dynamical systems theory to model thoughtseed dynamics and their contribution to the unitary nature of consciousness. The thoughtseed framework offers a promising step towards a novel, biologically-grounded model for understanding the organizing principles and emergence of embodied cognition, offering a unified account of cognitive phenomena, with potential applications in understanding consciousness, attention, and decision-making.",

Leveraging a deep active inference agent, we focus on controlling parallel and identical machine workstations to enhance energy efficiency. We address challenges posed by the problem's stochastic nature and delayed policy response by introducing tailored enhancements to existing agent architectures. Specifically, we introduce multi-step transition and hybrid horizon methods to mitigate the need for complex planning. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these enhancements and highlight the potential of the active inference-based approach.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous selection of optimal options for data collection from multiple alternatives is challenging in uncertain environments. When secondary information about options is accessible, such problems can be framed as contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs). Neuro-inspired active inference has gained interest for its ability to balance exploration and exploitation using the expected free energy objective function. Unlike previous studies that showed the effectiveness of active inference based strategy for CMABs using synthetic data, this study aims to apply active inference to realistic scenarios, using a simulated mineralogical survey site selection problem. Hyperspectral data from AVIRIS-NG at Cuprite, Nevada, serves as contextual information for predicting outcome probabilities, while geologists' mineral labels represent outcomes. Monte Carlo simulations assess the robustness of active inference against changing expert preferences. Results show that active inference requires fewer iterations than standard bandit approaches with real-world noisy and biased data, and performs better when outcome preferences vary online by adapting the selection strategy to align with expert shifts.",

      "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) has the unique potential to offer access to medical imaging to anyone, everywhere. Devices have become ultra-portable and cost-effective, akin to the stethoscope. Nevertheless US image quality and diagnostic efficacy are still highly operator- and patient-dependent. In difficult-to-image patients, image quality is often insufficient for reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we put forth that US imaging systems can be recast as information-seeking agents that engage in reciprocal interactions with their anatomical environment. Such agents autonomously adapt their transmit-receive sequences to fully personalize imaging and actively maximize information gain in-situ. To that end, we will show that the sequence of pulse-echo experiments that a US system performs can be interpreted as a perception-action loop: the action is the data acquisition, probing tissue with acoustic waves and recording reflections at the detection array, and perception is the inference of the anatomical and or functional state, potentially including associated diagnostic quantities. We then equip systems with a mechanism to actively reduce uncertainty and maximize diagnostic value across a sequence of experiments, treating action and perception jointly using Bayesian inference given generative models of the environment and action-conditional pulse-echo observations. Since the representation capacity of the generative models dictates both the quality of inferred anatomical states and the effectiveness of inferred sequences of future imaging actions, we will be greatly leveraging the enormous advances in deep generative modelling that are currently disrupting many fields and society at large. Finally, we show some examples of cognitive, closed-loop, US systems that perform active beamsteering and adaptive scanline selection, based on deep generative models that track anatomical belief states.",

Hence, they cannot capture the strategy developed by each subject and neither finely predict their learning curve. In this study, we propose an alternative, model-based approach rooted in cognitive skill learning within the Active Inference framework. We show how BCI training may be framed as an inference problem under high uncertainties. We illustrate the proposed approach on a previously published synthetic Motor Imagery ERD laterality training. We show how simple changes in model parameters allow us to qualitatively match experimental results and account for various subject.

This primer compares the underlying, intrinsic, utilities that may explain the self-organisation of collective behaviours near criticality. We focus on information-driven approaches (predictive information, empowerment, and active inference), as well as an approach incorporating both information theory and thermodynamics (thermodynamic efficiency). By interpreting the Ising model as a perception-action loop, we compare how different intrinsic utilities shape collective behaviour and analyse the distinct characteristics that arise when each is optimised. In particular, we highlight that thermodynamic efficiency -- measuring the ratio of predictability gained by the system to its energy costs -- reaches its maximum at the critical regime. Finally, we propose the Principle of Super-efficiency, suggesting that collective behaviours self-organise to the critical regime where optimal efficiency is achieved with respect to the entropy reduction relative to the thermodynamic costs.",

      "abstract": "We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.",

In addition, we propose the e-person framework based on the free energy principle, which considers the reduction of uncertainty as a unifying principle of brain function, with the aim of implementing the e-person architecture, and we show our previous works and future challenges based on the proposed framework.",

In this work, we propose a novel dual-layer AIF architecture that addresses both building-level and community-level energy management. By leveraging the free energy principle, each layer adapts to evolving conditions and handles partial observability without extensive sensor information and respecting data privacy. We validate the continuous AIF model against both a perfect optimization baseline and a reinforcement learning-based approach. We also test the community AIF framework under extreme pricing scenarios. The results highlight the model's robustness in handling abrupt changes. This study is the first to show how a distributed AIF works in engineering. It also highlights new opportunities for privacy-preserving and uncertainty-aware control strategies in engineering applications.",

Ensuring reliability and global consistency across these layers remains a major challenge, especially for AI-driven workloads requiring real-time, adaptive coordination. This work-in-progress paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems. PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free energy principle, and (iii) autonomously healing issues through active inference. Through continuous monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions. Theoretical validations confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

We propose a minimal FEP model for node behaviour reveals three distinct regimes: when detection noise dominates, agents seek better information, reducing isolated agents compared to expectations from classical preferential attachment. In the optimal detection regime, super-linear growth emerges from compounded improvements in detection, belief, and action, which produce a preferred cluster scale. Finally, saturation effects occur as limits on the agent's information processing capabilities prevent indefinite cluster growth. These regimes produce the knee-shaped degree distributions observed in real networks, explaining them as signatures of agents with optimal information processing under constraints. We show that agents evolving under FEP principles provides a mechanism for preferential attachment, connecting agent psychology with the macroscopic network features that underpin the structure of real-world networks.",

It remains fully compatible with standard BT architectures, allowing seamless integration into existing multi-robot control systems. Within this framework, multi-robot cooperation is formulated as a free-energy minimization process, where each robot dynamically updates its preference matrix based on perceptual inputs and peer intentions, thereby achieving adaptive coordination in partially observable and dynamic environments. The proposed approach is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, including a multi-robot maze navigation and a collaborative manipulation task, compared against traditional BTs(https://youtu.be/KX_oT3IDTf4).

Here, we propose a new planning framework, that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with active inference objectives to systematically reduce epistemic uncertainty while pursuing extrinsic rewards. Our key insight is that MCTS already renowned for its search efficiency can be naturally extended to incorporate free energy minimization by blending expected rewards with information gain. Concretely, the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is used to optimize action proposals at the root node, while tree expansions leverage reward modeling alongside intrinsic exploration bonuses. This synergy allows our planner to maintain coherent estimates of value and uncertainty throughout planning, without sacrificing computational tractability. Empirically, we benchmark our planner on a diverse set of continuous control tasks, where it demonstrates performance gains over both standalone CEM and MCTS with random rollouts.",

Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $π$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $π$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.",

In our framework, stakeholders need only specify their preferences over system outcomes, providing straightforward and transparent decision rules for risk governance and mitigation. This framework naturally accounts for uncertainty in both world model and preference model, allowing for decision-making that is epistemically and axiologically humble, parsimonious, and future-proof. We demonstrate this novel approach in a simplified autonomous vehicle environment with multi-agent vehicles whose driving policies are mediated by gatekeepers that evaluate, in an online fashion, the risk to the collective safety in their neighborhood, and intervene through each vehicle's policy when appropriate. We show that the introduction of gatekeepers in an AV fleet, even at low penetration, can generate significant positive externalities in terms of increased system safety.",

We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers.

Our design grammar has emerged from dialectical co-design with LLMs under asymmetric epistemic conditions--creating structured friction to expose blind spots and trade-offs.

These intrinsically motivated behaviors facilitate spontaneous exploration and learning of the body and environment during early developmental stages. Although computational modeling can offer insight into the mechanisms underlying such behaviors, many existing studies on intrinsic motivation focus primarily on how exploration contributes to acquiring external rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel density model for an agent's own multimodal sensory experiences, called the \"self-prior,\" and investigate whether it can autonomously induce goal-directed behavior. Integrated within an active inference framework based on the free energy principle, the self-prior generates behavioral references purely from an intrinsic process that minimizes mismatches between average past sensory experiences and current observations. This mechanism is also analogous to the acquisition and utilization of a body schema through continuous interaction with the environment. We examine this approach in a simulated environment and confirm that the agent spontaneously reaches toward a tactile stimulus. Our study implements intrinsically motivated behavior shaped by the agent's own sensory experiences, demonstrating the spontaneous emergence of intentional behavior during early development.",

Currently, many theories have attempted to explain the most essential difference between living systems and general systems, such as the self-organization theory and the free energy principle, but there is a lack of a reasonable indicator that can measure to what extent a system can be regarded as a system with life characteristics, especially the lack of attention to the dynamic characteristics of life systems. In this article, we propose a new indicator at the level of dynamic mechanisms to measure the ability of a system to flexibly respond to the environment. We proved that this indicator satisfies the axiom system of multivariate information decomposition in the partial information decomposition (PID) framework. Through further disassembly and analysis of this indicator, we found that it is determined by the degree of entanglement between system and environmental variables in the dynamics and the magnitude of noise. We conducted measurements on cellular automata (CA), random Boolean networks, and real gene regulatory networks (GRN), verified its relationship with the type of CA and the Langton parameter, and identified that the feedback loops have high abilities to flexibly respond to the environment on the GRN. We also combined machine learning technology to prove that this framework can be applied in the case of unknown dynamics.",

Existing theories and models have been developed to explain and predict these diverse patterns. While users often experience uncomfortable sensations, such as cybersickness, during virtual reality (VR) use, they do not always make optimal decisions to mitigate these effects. Although methods like reinforcement learning have been used to model decision-making processes, they typically rely on random selection to simulate actions, failing to capture the complexities of real navigation behavior. In this study, we propose curiosity as a key factor driving irrational decision-making, suggesting that users continuously balance exploration and cybersickness according to the free energy principle during virtual navigation. Our findings show that VR users generally adopt conservative strategies when navigating, with most participants displaying negative curiosity across trials. However, curiosity levels tend to rise when the virtual environment changes, illustrating the dynamic interplay between exploration and discomfort. This study provides a quantitative approach to decoding curiosity-driven behavior during virtual navigation, offering insights into how users balance exploration and the avoidance of cybersickness. Future research will further refine this model by incorporating additional psychological and environmental factors to improve the accuracy of navigation pattern predictions.",

      "abstract": "While biological neural networks develop from compact genomes using relatively simple rules, modern artificial neural architecture search methods mostly involve explicit and routine manual work. In this paper, we introduce MorphoNAS (Morphogenetic Neural Architecture Search), a system able to deterministically grow neural networks through morphogenetic self-organization inspired by the Free Energy Principle, reaction-diffusion systems, and gene regulatory networks. In MorphoNAS, simple genomes encode just morphogens dynamics and threshold-based rules of cellular development. Nevertheless, this leads to self-organization of a single progenitor cell into complex neural networks, while the entire process is built on local chemical interactions. Our evolutionary experiments focused on two different domains: structural targeting, in which MorphoNAS system was able to find fully successful genomes able to generate predefined random graph configurations (8-31 nodes); and functional performance on the CartPole control task achieving low complexity 6-7 neuron solutions when target network size minimization evolutionary pressure was applied. The evolutionary process successfully balanced between quality of of the final solutions and neural architecture search effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that the proposed MorphoNAS method is able to grow complex specific neural architectures, using simple developmental rules, which suggests a feasible biological route to adaptive and efficient neural architecture search.",

      "abstract": "There are various models proposed on how knowledge is generated in the human brain including the semantic networks model. Although this model has been widely studied and even computational models are presented, but, due to various limits and inefficiencies in the generation of different types of knowledge, its application is limited to semantic knowledge because of has been formed according to semantic memory and declarative knowledge and has many limits in explaining various procedural and conditional knowledge. Given the importance of providing an appropriate model for knowledge generation, especially in the areas of improving human cognitive functions or building intelligent machines, improving existing models in knowledge generation or providing more comprehensive models is of great importance. In the current study, based on the free energy principle of the brain, is the researchers proposed a model for generating three types of declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge. While explaining different types of knowledge, this model is capable to compute and generate concepts from stimuli based on probabilistic mathematics and the action-perception process (active inference). The proposed model is unsupervised learning that can update itself using a combination of different stimuli as a generative model can generate new concepts of unsupervised received stimuli. In this model, the active inference process is used in the generation of procedural and conditional knowledge and the perception process is used to generate declarative knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation compared to the state-of-the-art method.",

      "abstract": "Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely on a global error signal generated at the network's output.   In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly. Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information. Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle, linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty.   This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC, focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter (KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the mathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python examples using PyTorch.",

      "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has become an increasingly important paradigm in the domain of machine intelligence. Furthermore, evidence for self-supervised adaptation, such as contrastive formulations, has emerged in recent computational neuroscience and brain-inspired research. Nevertheless, current work on self-supervised learning relies on biologically implausible credit assignment -- in the form of backpropagation of errors -- and feedforward inference, typically a forward-locked pass. Predictive coding, in its mechanistic form, offers a biologically plausible means to sidestep these backprop-specific limitations. However, unsupervised predictive coding rests on learning a generative model of raw pixel input (akin to ``generative AI'' approaches), which entails predicting a potentially high dimensional input; on the other hand, supervised predictive coding, which learns a mapping between inputs to target labels, requires human annotation, and thus incurs the drawbacks of supervised learning. In this work, we present a scheme for self-supervised learning within a neurobiologically plausible framework that appeals to the free energy principle, constructing a new form of predictive coding that we call meta-representational predictive coding (MPC). MPC sidesteps the need for learning a generative model of sensory input (e.g., pixel-level features) by learning to predict representations of sensory input across parallel streams, resulting in an encoder-only learning and inference scheme. This formulation rests on active inference (in the form of sensory glimpsing) to drive the learning of representations, i.e., the representational dynamics are driven by sequences of decisions made by the model to sample informative portions of its sensorium.",

Here, we leverage the FEP to develop a mathematical physics approach to the identification of objects, object types, and the macroscopic, object-type-specific rules that govern their behavior. We take a generative modeling approach and use variational Bayesian expectation maximization to develop a dynamic Markov blanket detection algorithm that is capable of identifying and classifying macroscopic objects, given partial observation of microscopic dynamics. This unsupervised algorithm uses Bayesian attention to explicitly label observable microscopic elements according to their current role in a given system, as either the internal or boundary elements of a given macroscopic object; and it identifies macroscopic physical laws that govern how the object interacts with its environment. Because these labels are dynamic or evolve over time, the algorithm is capable of identifying complex objects that travel through fixed media or exchange matter with their environment. This approach leads directly to a flexible class of structured, unsupervised algorithms that sensibly partition complex many-particle or many-component systems into collections of interacting macroscopic subsystems, namely, ``objects'' or ``things''. We derive a few examples of this kind of macroscopic physics discovery algorithm and demonstrate its utility with simple numerical experiments, in which the algorithm correctly labels the components of Newton's cradle, a burning fuse, the Lorenz attractor, and a simulated cell.",

The author believes that one of the most important capabilities of the neocortex in addition to prediction is the ability to make association, that is, to find the relationships between objects. Similarity is an important example of such relationships. In our study, algorithms that run on the thousand-brains system to find similarities are proposed.

Karl Friston and his colleagues have studied the free-energy principle that explains how the brain actively infers the cause of a Shannon surprise. In our study, an algorithm is proposed for the thousand-brains system to make this inference. The problem of inferring what is being observed from the sensory data is a type of inverse problem, and the inference algorithms of the thousand-brains system and free-energy principle solve this problem in a Bayesian manner.

It lies at the heart of organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed, complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy. This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in active learning systems.",

Active inference (AIF) based on the free-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by minimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and extrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy generates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their long-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection that minimizes EFE. Real-world navigation experiments demonstrated that our framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the baselines, particularly in exploration-demanding scenarios.

While existing memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second, its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.",

A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty, and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness. Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle, pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.",

Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \\emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \\emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\\varnothing$, i.e., \\[ Δ= K\\big(O_{W,\\varnothing}\\big) - K\\big(O_{W,R}\\big) > 0. \\] We then prove that the larger $Δ$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $Δ> 0$ yields \\[ \\Pr\\big((W,R)\\mid x\\big) \\le C\\,2^{\\,M(W{:}R)}\\,2^{-Δ}, \\] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $Δ$ grows.

      "abstract": "We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation, incorporating both positive and \"negative\" sensor observations of possible target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy, we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target objects.",

Each agent maintains a self-model that tracks violations in its predictive coherence while recursively modeling the other. Valence is computed from self-model prediction error, weighted by self-relevance, and modulated by prior affective states and by what we term temporal aiming, which captures affective appraisal over time. This accommodates shifts in the self-other boundary, allowing affect to emerge at individual and dyadic levels. We propose a novel method termed geometric hyperscanning, based on the Forman-Ricci curvature, to empirically operationalize these processes: it tracks topological reconfigurations in inter-brain networks, with its entro-py serving as a proxy for affective phase transitions such as rupture, co-regulation, and re-attunement.",

We present an AIF agent with continuous state, action, and observation spaces, performing one-dimensional mouse pointing and clicking. We use a simple underlying dynamic system to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic perceptual delay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based models, the agent's actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy, solely based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing clicking a button correctly. Our results show that the agent creates plausible pointing movements and clicks when the cursor is over the target, with similar end-point variance to human users. In contrast to other models of pointing, we incorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compensation into the agent. The agent shows distinct behaviour for differing target difficulties without the need to retune system parameters, as done in other approaches. We discuss the simulation results and emphasize the challenges in identifying the correct configuration of an AIF agent interacting with continuous systems.",

      "abstract": "High-level theories rooted in the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis often frame cognitive effort as the cost of resolving the conflict between habits and optimal policies. In parallel, evidence accumulator models (EAMs) provide a mechanistic account of how effort arises from competition between the subjective values of available options. Although EAMs have been combined with frameworks like Reinforcement Learning to bridge the gap between high-level theories and process-level mechanisms, relatively less attention has been paid to their implications for a unified notion of cognitive effort. Here, we combine Active Inference (AIF) with the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to investigate whether the resulting AIF-DDM can simultaneously account for effort arising from both habit violation and value discriminability. To our knowledge, this is the first time AIF has been combined with an EAM. We tested the AIF-DDM on a behavioral dataset from the two-step task and compared its predictions to an information-theoretic definition of cognitive effort based on AIF. The model's predictions successfully accounted for second-stage reaction times but failed to capture the dynamics of the first stage. We argue the latter discrepancy likely stems from the experimental design rather than a fundamental flaw in the model's assumptions about cognitive effort. Accordingly, we propose several modifications of the two-step task to better measure and isolate cognitive effort. Finally, we found that integrating the DDM significantly improved parameter recovery, which could help future studies to obtain more reliable parameter estimates.",

      "abstract": "Digital twins are transforming engineering and applied sciences by enabling real-time monitoring, simulation, and predictive analysis of physical systems and processes. However, conventional digital twins rely primarily on passive data assimilation, which limits their adaptability in uncertain and dynamic environments. This paper introduces the active digital twin paradigm, based on active inference. Active inference is a neuroscience-inspired, Bayesian framework for probabilistic reasoning and predictive modeling that unifies inference, decision-making, and learning under a unique, free energy minimization objective. By formulating the evolution of the active digital twin as a partially observable Markov decision process, the active inference agent continuously refines its generative model through Bayesian updates and forecasts future states and observations. Decision-making emerges from an optimization process that balances pragmatic exploitation (maximizing goal-directed utility) and epistemic exploration or information gain (actively resolving uncertainty). Actions are dynamically planned to minimize expected free energy, which quantifies both the divergence between predicted and preferred future observations, and the epistemic value of expected information gain about hidden states. This approach enables a new level of autonomy and resilience in digital twins, offering superior spontaneous exploration capabilities. The proposed framework is assessed on the health monitoring and predictive maintenance of a railway bridge.",

To investigate this claim, we present multiple examples that challenge the subsumption thesis. To formally compare these two accounts of agency, we analyze the objective functions for MDPs and POMDPs. By imposing information-theoretic rationality bounds (ITBR) on the expected utility agent, we find that the resultant agency is equivalent to that of active inference in MDPs, but slightly different in POMDPs. Rather than being strictly resolved, the subsumption thesis motivates the construction of a formal bridge between active inference and expected utility. This highlights the necessary formal assumptions and frameworks to make these disparate accounts of agency commensurable.",

Traditional autonomous driving approaches--including modular pipelines, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning--struggle with adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. In contrast, PML with AIF leverages a generative model to minimize prediction error (\"surprise\") and actively shape vehicle control based on learned perceptual-motor representations. Our approach unifies deep learning with active inference principles, allowing HAVs to perform lane-keeping maneuvers with minimal data and without extensive retraining across different environments. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that PML with AIF enhances adaptability without increasing computational overhead while achieving performance comparable to conventional methods.

This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a novel computational cognitive model of human collision avoidance behavior based on active inference. Active inference provides a unified approach to modeling human behavior: the minimization of free energy. Building on prior active inference work, our model incorporates established cognitive mechanisms such as evidence accumulation to simulate human responses in two distinct collision avoidance scenarios: front-to-rear lead vehicle braking and lateral incursion by an oncoming vehicle. We demonstrate that our model explains a wide range of previous empirical findings on human collision avoidance behavior. Specifically, the model closely reproduces both aggregate results from meta-analyses previously reported in the literature and detailed, scenario-specific effects observed in a recent driving simulator study, including response timing, maneuver selection, and execution.

Fast-forwarding, there is now growing awareness that we have to completely change our networks from being static into being a living entity that would act as an AI-powered network `brain', as recently stated by Bruno Zerbib, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of France's Orange, at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025. Even though AI was front and center at both MWC and OFC 2025 and has been widely studied in the context of optical networks, there are currently no publications on active inference in optical (and less so mobile) networks available. Active inference is an ideal methodology for developing more advanced AI systems by biomimicking the way living intelligent systems work, while overcoming the limitations of today's AI related to training, learning, and explainability. Active inference is considered the key to true AI: Less artificial, more intelligent. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we aim at enabling optical network researchers to conceptualize new research lines for future optical networks with human-AI interaction capabilities by introducing them to the main mathematical concepts of the active inference framework. Second, we demonstrate how to move AI research beyond the human brain toward the 6G world brain by exploring the role of mycorrhizal networks, the largest living organism on planet Earth, in the AI vision and R&D roadmap for the next decade and beyond laid out by Karl Friston, the father of active inference.",

Our framework leverages natural language as a medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures. The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our framework's safety properties.

In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration).",

      "abstract": "We present a method for active inference with partial observations in stochastic systems through incentive design, also known as the leader-follower game. Consider a leader agent who aims to infer a follower agent's type given a finite set of possible types. Different types of followers differ in either the dynamical model, the reward function, or both. We assume the leader can partially observe a follower's behavior in the stochastic system modeled as a Markov decision process, in which the follower takes an optimal policy to maximize a total reward. To improve inference accuracy and efficiency, the leader can offer side payments (incentives) to the followers such that different types of them, under the incentive design, can exhibit diverging behaviors that facilitate the leader's inference task. We show the problem of active inference through incentive design can be formulated as a special class of leader-follower games, where the leader's objective is to balance the information gain and cost of incentive design. The information gain is measured by the entropy of the estimated follower's type given partial observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this problem can be solved by reducing a single-level optimization through softmax temporal consistency between followers' policies and value functions. This reduction allows us to develop an efficient gradient-based algorithm. We utilize observable operators in the hidden Markov model (HMM) to compute the necessary gradients and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in stochastic grid world environments.",

      "abstract": "Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.",

To address these issues, we propose a formal computational model of the NFT closed loop. Using Active Inference, a Bayesian framework modelling perception, action, and learning, we simulate agents interacting with an NFT environment. This enables us to test the impact of design choices (e.g., feedback quality, biomarker validity) and subject factors (e.g., prior beliefs) on training. Simulations show that training effectiveness is sensitive to feedback noise or bias, and to prior beliefs (highlighting the importance of guiding instructions), but also reveal that perfect feedback is insufficient to guarantee high performance.

We present a novel approach to multi-agent cooperation by implementing ToM within active inference. Unlike previous active inference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on task-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication. In our framework, ToM-equipped agents maintain distinct representations of their own and others' beliefs and goals. ToM agents then use an extended and adapted version of the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. We evaluate our approach through collision avoidance and foraging simulations. Results suggest that ToM agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM counterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts. Crucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from observable behaviour and considering them when planning their own actions. Our approach shows potential for generalisable and scalable multi-agent systems while providing computational insights into ToM mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.",

To test the effectiveness of the model, we analyze its behavior in the Posner cueing task and a simple target focus task using two-dimensional(2D) visual data. Reaction times are measured to investigate the interplay between exogenous and endogenous attention, as well as valid and invalid cueing. The results show that exogenous and valid cues generally lead to faster reaction times compared to endogenous and invalid cues. Furthermore, the model exhibits behavior similar to inhibition of return, where previously attended locations become suppressed after a specific cue-target onset asynchrony interval. Lastly, we investigate different aspects of overt attention and show that involuntary, reflexive saccades occur faster than intentional ones, but at the expense of adaptability.",

      "abstract": "How could primordial life, before the evolution of genetic systems, adapt to fluctuating environments and achieve homeostasis? This study proposes a minimal, chemically plausible model where homeostasis emerges from a simple chemical reaction network. It utilizes an internal Lotka-Volterra chemical oscillator as a \"search engine\" to periodically vary a protocell's pigmentation. The system then optimizes its internal state by evaluating the temporal correlation between these internal fluctuations and a single global metric,the cell's self-replication rate, through a mechanism termed \"antagonistic memory molecules.\" Numerical simulations demonstrate that the model can autonomously converge to and maintain the optimal temperature for its self-replication, even amidst significant environmental fluctuations. These findings provide a constructive proof-of-concept for how a core process of active inference can emerge from a simple physicochemical system, offering a concrete scenario for the acquisition of adaptive capabilities at the origin of life.",

      "abstract": "This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we identify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical constraints.",

      "abstract": "The Computing Continuum (CC) is an emerging Internet-based computing paradigm that spans from local Internet of Things sensors and constrained edge devices to large-scale cloud data centers. Its goal is to orchestrate a vast array of diverse and distributed computing resources to support the next generation of Internet-based applications. However, the distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic nature of CC platforms demands distributed intelligence for adaptive and resilient service management. This article introduces a distributed stream processing pipeline as a CC use case, where each service is managed by an Active Inference (AIF) agent. These agents collaborate to fulfill service needs specified by SLOiDs, a term we introduce to denote Service Level Objectives that are aware of its deployed devices, meaning that non-functional requirements must consider the characteristics of the hosting device. We demonstrate how AIF agents can be modeled and deployed alongside distributed services to manage them autonomously. Our experiments show that AIF agents achieve over 90% SLOiD fulfillment when using tested transition models, and around 80% when learning the models during deployment. We compare their performance to a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, finding that while both approaches yield similar results, MARL requires extensive training, whereas AIF agents can operate effectively from the start. Additionally, we evaluate the behavior of AIF agents in offloading scenarios, observing a strong capacity for adaptation. Finally, we outline key research directions to advance AIF integration in CC platforms.",

Communication (i.e., ``\\textit{Tell}'') can assist in the cognitive development process by information dissemination, yet it is inevitably subject to real-world constraints such as noise, latency, and attacks. Therefore, building the understanding of teammates' decisions without communication remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel non-communication MARL framework that realizes the construction of cognition through local observation-based modeling (i.e., \\textit{``Think''}). Our framework enables agents to model teammates' \\textbf{active inference} process. At first, the proposed method produces three teammate portraits: perception-belief-action. Specifically, we model the teammate's decision process as follows: 1) Perception: observing environments; 2) Belief: forming beliefs; 3) Action: making decisions. Then, we selectively integrate the belief portrait into the decision process based on the accuracy and relevance of the perception portrait. This enables the selection of cooperative teammates and facilitates effective collaboration. Extensive experiments on the SMAC, SMACv2, MPE, and GRF benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method.",

      "abstract": "With the recent success of world-model agents, which extend the core idea of model-based reinforcement learning by learning a differentiable model for sample-efficient control across diverse tasks, active inference (AIF) offers a complementary, neuroscience-grounded paradigm that unifies perception, learning, and action within a single probabilistic framework powered by a generative model. Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on accurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is exacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to hundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or vision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of real-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a generative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition that lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single look-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and receives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating optimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and (iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating exhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and long-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism yields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision making in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or expensive planning.",

This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.",

      "abstract": "The concept of power can be explored at several scales: from physical action and process effectuation, all the way to complex social dynamics. A spectrum-wide analysis of power requires attention to the fundamental principles that constrain these processes. In the social realm, the acquisition and maintenance of power is intertwined with both social interactions and cognitive processing capacity: socially-facilitated empowerment grants agents more information-processing capacities and opportunities, either by relying on others to bring about desired policies or ultimately outcomes, and/or by enjoying more information-processing possibilities as a result of relying on others for the reproduction of (material) tasks. The effects of social empowerment thus imply an increased ability to harness computation toward desired ends, thereby augmenting the evolution of a specific state space. Empowered individuals attract the attention of others, who contribute to increasing the scale of their access to various policies effectuating these state spaces. The presented argument posits that social power, in the context of active inference, is a function of several variables. As a result of its power-amplifying effects, this extended computational ability also buffers against possible vulnerabilities. We propose that individuals wield power not only by associating with others possessing desirable policies, but also by enhancing their ability to intake and compute information effectively. This dual mechanism is argued to create a cyclical, reinforcing pattern wherein the empowered are able to incrementally expand the scope of policies and state spaces available to them while minimizing risk-exposure.",

The ensuing model aims to capture the complexity of human decision-making under legal constraints, offering a candidate mechanism for agent governance in AI systems, that is, the (auto)regulation of AI agents themselves rather than human actors in the AI industry. We propose that lawful and norm-sensitive AI behavior can be achieved through regulation by design, where agents are endowed with intentional control systems, or behavioral safety valves, that guide real-time decisions in accordance with normative expectations. To illustrate this, we simulate an autonomous driving scenario in which an AI agent must decide when to yield the right of way by balancing competing legal and pragmatic imperatives. The model formalizes how AIF can implement context-dependent preferences to resolve such conflicts, linking this mechanism to the conception of law as a scaffold for rational decision-making under uncertainty. We conclude by discussing how context-dependent preferences could function as safety mechanisms for autonomous agents, enhancing lawful alignment and risk mitigation in AI governance.",

It actively defends its cherished beliefs even in the face of contradictory evidence, conveniently interprets information to conform to desired narratives, and selectively searches for or avoids information to suit its various purposes. Despite these behaviours deviating from common normative standards for belief updating, we argue that such 'biases' are not inherently cognitive flaws, but rather an adaptive response to the significant pragmatic and cognitive costs associated with revising one's beliefs. This paper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these costs on our belief updating mechanisms.   We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents weigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost required to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform computational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this resource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human behaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation. In doing so, we suggest that this framework makes steps toward a more holistic account of the motivated Bayesian mechanics of belief change and provides practical insights for predicting, compensating for, and correcting deviations from desired belief updating processes.",

This perspective contends that progress turns on closing three mutually reinforcing gaps in abstraction, reasoning and empirical grounding. Central to addressing these gaps is recognizing complementary cognitive modes: thinking as slow, iterative hypothesis generation -- exploring counterfactual spaces where physical laws can be temporarily violated to discover new patterns -- and reasoning as fast, deterministic validation, traversing established knowledge graphs to test consistency with known principles. Abstractions in this loop should be manipulable models that enable counterfactual prediction, causal attribution, and refinement. Design principles -- rather than a monolithic recipe -- are proposed for systems that reason in imaginary spaces and learn from the world: causal, multimodal models for internal simulation; persistent, uncertainty-aware scientific memory that distinguishes hypotheses from established claims; formal verification pathways coupled to computations and experiments. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties make human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent architectural component. Evaluations must assess the system's ability to identify novel phenomena, propose falsifiable hypotheses, and efficiently guide experimental programs toward genuine discoveries.",

Our framework integrates an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module, which utilizes active inference to predict reliable modalities based on posterior distributions and subsequently organizes them accordingly. Unlike reinforcement learning, active inference replaces rewards with evidence-based preferences, making more stable predictions. Additionally, we introduce an active mutual distillation module that enhances the representation learning of less reliable modalities by transferring knowledge from more reliable ones. Adaptive multimodal inference is employed during the meta-test to assign higher weights to reliable modalities.

Our approach integrates the active inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling intrinsically motivated developmental learning. The simulations reveal several key findings: i) Generalization improves markedly as the scale of compositional elements increases. ii) Curiosity combined with motor noise yields substantially better learning than exploration without curiosity. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions precedes the emergence of compositional generalization. iv) Simpler, prerequisite-like actions develop earlier than more complex actions that depend on them. v) When exception-handling rules were introduced -- where certain imperative sentences required executing inconsistent actions -- the robots successfully acquired these exceptions through exploration and displayed a U-shaped performance curve characteristic of representational redescription in child language learning.

      "abstract": "TinyML has made deploying deep learning models on low-power edge devices feasible, creating new opportunities for real-time perception in constrained environments. However, the adaptability of such deep learning methods remains limited to data drift adaptation, lacking broader capabilities that account for the environment's underlying dynamics and inherent uncertainty. Deep learning's scaling laws, which counterbalance this limitation by massively up-scaling data and model size, cannot be applied when deploying on the Edge, where deep learning limitations are further amplified as models are scaled down for deployment on resource-constrained devices.   This paper presents an innovative agentic system capable of performing on-device perception and planning, enabling active sensing on the edge. By incorporating active inference into our solution, our approach extends beyond deep learning capabilities, allowing the system to plan in dynamic environments while operating in real-time with a compact memory footprint of as little as 300 MB. We showcase our proposed system by creating and deploying a saccade agent connected to an IoT camera with pan and tilt capabilities on an NVIDIA Jetson embedded device. The saccade agent controls the camera's field of view following optimal policies derived from the active inference principles, simulating human-like saccadic motion for surveillance and robotics applications.",

      "abstract": "Current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance in various domains, but struggle with data efficiency compared to human learning, which leverages core priors about objects and their interactions. Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM, combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions. The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based optimization.",

      "abstract": "Neuromorphic Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a theoretical approach to designing better user experiences (UX) motivated by advances in the understanding of the neurophysiology of the brain. Inspired by the neuroscientific theory of Active Inference, Interactive Inference is a first example of such approach. It offers a simplified interpretation of Active Inference that allows designers to more readily apply this theory to design and evaluation. In Interactive Inference, user behaviour is modeled as Bayesian inference on progress and goal distributions that predicts the next action. We show how the error between goal and progress distributions, or Bayesian surprise, can be modeled as a simple mean square error of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a task. The problem is that the user's capacity to process Bayesian surprise follows the logarithm of this SNR. This means errors rise quickly once average capacity is exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and error using one framework that can provide real-time estimates of the mental load in users that needs to be minimized by design. We show how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts' Law and the Power Law can be expressed using our model. We then test the validity of the model by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance and error in a car following task. Results suggest that driver processing capacity indeed is a logarithmic function of the SNR of the distance to a lead car. This result provides initial evidence that Interactive Interference can be useful as a new theoretical design tool.",

      "abstract": "Measurement of a physical quantity such as light intensity is an integral part of many reconstruction and decision scenarios but can be costly in terms of acquisition time, invasion of or damage to the environment and storage. Data minimisation and compliance with data protection laws is also an important consideration. Where there are a range of measurements that can be made, some may be more informative and compliant with the overall measurement objective than others. We develop an active sequential inference algorithm that uses the low dimensional representational latent space from a variational autoencoder (VAE) to choose which measurement to make next. Our aim is to recover high dimensional data by making as few measurements as possible. We adapt the VAE encoder to map partial data measurements on to the latent space of the complete data. The algorithm draws samples from this latent space and uses the VAE decoder to generate data conditional on the partial measurements. Estimated measurements are made on the generated data and fed back through the partial VAE encoder to the latent space where they can be evaluated prior to making a measurement. Starting from no measurements and a normal prior on the latent space, we consider alternative strategies for choosing the next measurement and updating the predictive posterior prior for the next step. The algorithm is illustrated using the Fashion MNIST dataset and a novel convolutional Hadamard pattern measurement basis. We see that useful patterns are chosen within 10 steps, leading to the convergence of the guiding generative images. Compared with using stochastic variational inference to infer the parameters of the posterior distribution for each generated data point individually, the partial VAE framework can efficiently process batches of generated data and obtains superior results with minimal measurements.",

Through simulations of the perceptual crossing paradigm, we explore the effect of various internal reward functions in reinforcement learning agents. The drive to understand is implemented as an active inference type artificial curiosity reward, whereas the drive to be understood is implemented through intrinsic rewards for imitation, influence/impressionability, and sub-reaction time anticipation of the other. Results indicate that while artificial curiosity alone does not lead to a preference for social interaction, rewards emphasizing reciprocal understanding successfully drive agents to prioritize interaction. We demonstrate that this intrinsic motivation can facilitate cooperation in tasks where only one agent receives extrinsic reward for the behaviour of the other.",

Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking. This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations, providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in artificial agents.",

Third, non-duality dissolves adversarial self-other boundaries. Fourth, boundless care motivates the universal reduction of suffering. We find that prompting AI to reflect on these principles improves performance on the AILuminate Benchmark (d=.96) and boosts cooperation and joint-reward on the Prisoner's Dilemma task (d=7+). We offer detailed implementation strategies at the level of architectures, constitutions, and reinforcement on chain-of-thought.

Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research.",

However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge for practical and socially appropriate task execution.",

However, addressing potential communication failures or the lack of communication infrastructure in these fields remains a challenge. A significant portion of MRS research presumes that the system can maintain communication with proximity constraints, but this approach does not solve situations where communication is either non-existent, unreliable, or poses a security risk. Some approaches tackle this issue using predictions about other robots while not communicating, but these methods generally only permit agents to utilize first-order reasoning, which involves reasoning based purely on their own observations. In contrast, to deal with this problem, our proposed framework utilizes Theory of Mind (ToM), employing higher-order reasoning by shifting a robot's perspective to reason about a belief of others observations. Our approach has two main phases: i) an efficient runtime plan adaptation using active inference to signal intentions and reason about a robot's own belief and the beliefs of others in the system, and ii) a hierarchical epistemic planning framework to iteratively reason about the current MRS mission state. The proposed framework outperforms greedy and first-order reasoning approaches and is validated using simulations and experiments with heterogeneous robotic systems.",

      "abstract": "Studying psychiatric illness has often been limited by difficulties in connecting symptoms and behavior to neurobiology. Computational psychiatry approaches promise to bridge this gap by providing formal accounts of the latent information processing changes that underlie the development and maintenance of psychiatric phenomena. Models based on these theories generate individual-level parameter estimates which can then be tested for relationships to neurobiology. In this review, we explore computational modelling approaches to one key aspect of health and illness: affect. We discuss strengths and limitations of key approaches to modelling affect, with a focus on reinforcement learning, active inference, the hierarchical gaussian filter, and drift-diffusion models. We find that, in this literature, affect is an important source of modulation in decision making, and has a bidirectional influence on how individuals infer both internal and external states. Highlighting the potential role of affect in information processing changes underlying symptom development, we extend an existing model of psychosis, where affective changes are influenced by increasing cortical noise and consequent increases in either perceived environmental instability or expected noise in sensory input, becoming part of a self-reinforcing process generating negatively valenced, over-weighted priors underlying positive symptom development. We then provide testable predictions from this model at computational, neurobiological, and phenomenological levels of description.",

      "abstract": "As neuroscientific theories of consciousness continue to proliferate, the need to assess their similarities and differences -- as well as their predictive and explanatory power -- becomes ever more pressing. Recently, a number of structured adversarial collaborations have been devised to test the competing predictions of several candidate theories of consciousness. In this review, we compare and contrast three theories being investigated in one such adversarial collaboration: Integrated Information Theory, Neurorepresentationalism, and Active Inference. We begin by presenting the core claims of each theory, before comparing them in terms of (1) the phenomena they seek to explain, (2) the sorts of explanations they avail, and (3) the methodological strategies they endorse. We then consider some of the inherent challenges of theory testing, and how adversarial collaboration addresses some of these difficulties. More specifically, we outline the key hypotheses that will be tested in this adversarial collaboration, and exemplify how contrasting empirical predictions may pertain to core and auxiliary components of each theory. Finally, we discuss how the data harvested across disparate experiments (and their replicates) may be formally integrated to provide a quantitative measure of the evidential support accrued under each theory. We suggest this approach to theory comparison may afford a useful metric for tracking the amount of scientific progress being made in consciousness research.",

      "abstract": "The integration of the Internet of Everything (IoX) and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has given rise to a transformative paradigm aimed at addressing critical bottlenecks across sensing, network, and application layers in Cyber-Physical-Social Thinking (CPST) ecosystems. In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of AGI-enhanced IoX research, focusing on three key components: sensing-layer data management, network-layer protocol optimization, and application-layer decision-making frameworks. Specifically, this survey explores how AGI can mitigate IoX bottlenecks challenges by leveraging adaptive sensor fusion, edge preprocessing, and selective attention mechanisms at the sensing layer, while resolving network-layer issues such as protocol heterogeneity and dynamic spectrum management, neuro-symbolic reasoning, active inference, and causal reasoning, Furthermore, the survey examines AGI-enabled frameworks for managing identity and relationship explosion. Key findings suggest that AGI-driven strategies, such as adaptive sensor fusion, edge preprocessing, and semantic modeling, offer novel solutions to sensing-layer data overload, network-layer protocol heterogeneity, and application-layer identity explosion. The survey underscores the importance of cross-layer integration, quantum-enabled communication, and ethical governance frameworks for future AGI-enabled IoX systems. Finally, the survey identifies unresolved challenges, such as computational requirements, scalability, and real-world validation, calling for further research to fully realize AGI's potential in addressing IoX bottlenecks. we believe AGI-enhanced IoX is emerging as a critical research field at the intersection of interconnected systems and advanced AI.",

      "abstract": "Predictive processing and active inference posit that the brain is a system performing Bayesian inference on the environment. By virtue of this, a prominent interpretation of predictive processing states that the generative model (a POMDP) encoded by the brain synchronises with the generative process (another POMDP) representing the environment while trying to explain what hidden properties of the world generated its sensory input. In this view, the brain is thought to become a copy of the environment. This claim has however been disputed, stressing the fact that a structural copy, or isomorphism as it is at times invoked to be, is not an accurate description of this process since the environment is necessarily more complex than the brain, and what matters is not the capacity to exactly recapitulate the veridical causal structure of the world. In this work, we make parts of this counterargument formal by using ideas from the theory of coalgebras, an abstract mathematical framework for dynamical systems that brings together work from automata theory, concurrency theory, probabilistic processes and other fields. To do so, we cast generative model and process, in the form of POMDPs, as coalgebras, and use maps between them to describe a form of consistency that goes beyond mere structural similarity, giving the necessary mathematical background to describe how different processes can be seen as behaviourally, rather than structurally, equivalent, i.e. how they can be seen as emitting the same observations, and thus minimise prediction error, over time without strict assumptions about structural similarity. In particular, we will introduce three standard notions of equivalence from the literature on coalgebras, evaluating them in the context of predictive processing and identifying the one closest to claims made by proponents of this framework.",

By developing a recursive Bayesian fixed-point smoother to estimate the initial state that resembles the standard recursive Bayesian filter, we show that ISC-POMDPs can be treated as POMDPs with (potentially) belief-dependent costs.

A popular trend of injecting such specification is adding a prefix (e.g. prior relevant conversations) to the current user's conversation to steer preference distribution. Most methods passively model personal preferences with prior example preferences pairs. We ask whether models benefit from actively inferring preference descriptions, and address this question by creating a synthetic personalized alignment dataset based on famous people with known public preferences. We then test how effective finetuned 1-8B size models are at inferring and aligning to personal preferences. Results show that higher-quality active prefixes lead to better generalization, more contextually faithful models, and less systematic biases across different protected attributes. All our results suggest active alignment can lead to a more controllable and efficient path for personalized alignment.",

We build on the existing framework of Self-AIXI -- a universal learning agent that predicts its own actions -- by showing how one of its established terms can be interpreted as a variational empowerment objective. We further demonstrate that universal AI's planning process can be cast as minimizing expected variational free energy (the core principle of active Inference), thereby revealing how universal AI agents inherently balance goal-directed behavior with uncertainty reduction curiosity). Moreover, we argue that power-seeking tendencies of universal AI agents can be explained not only as an instrumental strategy to secure future reward, but also as a direct consequence of empowerment maximization -- i.e. the agent's intrinsic drive to maintain or expand its own controllability in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to show how these intrinsic motivations (empowerment, curiosity) systematically lead universal AI agents to seek and sustain high-optionality states. We prove that Self-AIXI asymptotically converges to the same performance as AIXI under suitable conditions, and highlight that its power-seeking behavior emerges naturally from both reward maximization and curiosity-driven exploration. Since AIXI can be view as a Bayes-optimal mathematical formulation for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), our result can be useful for further discussion on AI safety and the controllability of AGI.",

However, teleoperation is difficult since the operator feels a disconnect with the robot caused by missing feedback from several senses, including touch, and the lack of depth in the video feedback presented to the operator. To overcome this problem, the proposed system actively infers the operator's intent and provides assistance based on the predicted intent. Furthermore, a novel method of calculating confidence in the inferred intent modifies the human-in-the-loop control. The operator's gaze is employed to intuitively indicate the target before the manipulation with the robot begins. A potential field method is used to provide a guiding force towards the intended target, and a safety boundary reduces risk of damage. Modifying these assistances based on the confidence level in the operator's intent makes the control more natural, and gives the robot an intuitive understanding of its human master. Initial validation results show the ability of the system to improve accuracy, execution time, and reduce operator error.",

Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated (and then estimated) in a principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's predictive distributions and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its construction and updating procedure. We find that BED-LLM achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on the 20 questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences, compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.",

While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16 pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support more flexible sparsity patterns.

Current methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering truly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized dialogues. Existing personalization approaches typically rely on extensive user history, limiting their effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging a user model to incorporate a curiosity-based intrinsic reward into multi-turn RLHF. This novel reward mechanism encourages the LLM agent to actively infer user traits by optimizing conversations to improve its user model's accuracy. Consequently, the agent delivers more personalized interactions by learning more about the user. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two distinct domains: significantly improving personalization performance in a conversational recommendation task, and personalizing conversations for different learning styles in an educational setting. We show improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional multi-turn RLHF, all while maintaining conversation quality. Our method offers a promising solution for creating more personalized, adaptive, and engaging conversational agents.",

      "abstract": "We analyse ESPRESSO data for the stars HD10700, HD20794, HD102365, and HD304636 acquired via its Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) programme. We characterise the stars' radial velocity (RV) signals down to a precision of 10 cm/s on timescales ranging from minutes to planetary periods falling within the host's habitable zone (HZ). We study the RV signature of pulsation, granulation, and stellar activity, inferring the potential presence of planets around these stars. Thus, we outline the population of planets that while undetectable remain compatible with the available data.   A simple model of stellar pulsations successfully reproduced the intra-night RV scatter of HD10700 down to a few cm/s. For HD102365 and HD20794, an additional source of scatter at the level of several 10 cm/s remains necessary to explain the data. A kima analysis was used to evaluate the number of planets supported by the nightly averaged time series of each of HD10700, HD102365, and HD304636, under the assumption that a quasi-periodic Gaussian process (GP) regression is able to model the activity signal. While a frequency analysis of HD10700 RVs is able to identify a periodic signal at 20d, when it is modelled along with the activity signal the signal is formally non-significant. ESPRESSO data on their own do not provide conclusive evidence for the existence of planets around these three stars.   ESPRESSO is shown to reach an on-sky RV precision of better than 10 cm/s on short timescales (<1h) and of 40 cm/s over 3.5 yr. A subdivision of the datasets showcases a precision reaching 20-30 cm/s over one year. These results impose stringent constraints on the impact of granulation mechanisms on RV. In spite of no detections, our analysis of HD10700 RVs demonstrates a sensitivity to planets with a mass of 1.7M$_{\\oplus}$ for periods of up to 100 d, and a mass of 2-5M$_{\\oplus}$ for the star's HZ.

      "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) describes (biological) agents as minimising a variational Free Energy (FE) with respect to a generative model of their environment. Active Inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that describes how agents explore and exploit their environment by minimising an expected FE objective. In two related papers, we describe a scalable, epistemic approach to synthetic AIF, by message passing on free-form Forney-style Factor Graphs (FFGs). A companion paper (part I) introduces a Constrained FFG (CFFG) notation that visually represents (generalised) FE objectives for AIF. The current paper (part II) derives message passing algorithms that minimise (generalised) FE objectives on a CFFG by variational calculus. A comparison between simulated Bethe and generalised FE agents illustrates how the message passing approach to synthetic AIF induces epistemic behaviour on a T-maze navigation task. Extension of the T-maze simulation to 1) learning goal statistics, and 2) a multi-agent bargaining setting, illustrate how this approach encourages reuse of nodes and updates in alternative settings. With a full message passing account of synthetic AIF agents, it becomes possible to derive and reuse message updates across models and move closer to industrial applications of synthetic AIF.",

      "abstract": "Epistemic emotions, such as curiosity and interest, drive the inquiry process. This study proposes a novel formulation of epistemic emotions such as curiosity and interest using two types of information gain generated by the principle of free energy minimization: Kullback-Leibler divergence(KLD) from Bayesian posterior to prior, which represents free energy reduction in recognition, and Bayesian surprise (BS), which represents the expected information gain by Bayesian prior update. By applying a Gaussian generative model with an additional uniform likelihood, we found that KLD and BS form an upward-convex function of surprise (minimized free energy and prediction error), similar to Berlyne's arousal potential functions, or the Wundt curve. We consider that the alternate maximization of BS and KLD generates an ideal inquiry cycle to approach the optimal arousal level with fluctuations in surprise, and that curiosity and interest drive to facilitate the cyclic process. We exhaustively analyzed the effects of prediction uncertainty (prior variance) and observation uncertainty (likelihood variance) on the peaks of the information gain function as optimal surprises. The results show that greater prediction uncertainty, meaning an open-minded attitude, and less observational uncertainty, meaning precise observation with attention, are expected to provide greater information gains through a greater range of exploration. The proposed mathematical framework unifies the free energy principle of the brain and the arousal potential theory to explain the Wundt curve as an information gain function and suggests an ideal inquiry process driven by epistemic emotions.",

      "abstract": "The way the brain selects and controls actions is still widely debated. Mainstream approaches based on Optimal Control focus on stimulus-response mappings that optimize cost functions. Ideomotor theory and cybernetics propose a different perspective: they suggest that actions are selected and controlled by activating action effects and by continuously matching internal predictions with sensations. Active Inference offers a modern formulation of these ideas, in terms of inferential mechanisms and prediction-error-based control, which can be linked to neural mechanisms of living organisms. This article provides a technical illustration of Active Inference models in continuous time and a brief survey of Active Inference models that solve four kinds of control problems; namely, the control of goal-directed reaching movements, active sensing, the resolution of multisensory conflict during movement and the integration of decision-making and motor control. Crucially, in Active Inference, all these different facets of motor control emerge from the same optimization process - namely, the minimization of Free Energy - and do not require designing separate cost functions. Therefore, Active Inference provides a unitary perspective on various aspects of motor control that can inform both the study of biological control mechanisms and the design of artificial and robotic systems.",

      "abstract": "Despite being recognized as neurobiologically plausible, active inference faces difficulties when employed to simulate intelligent behaviour in complex environments due to its computational cost and the difficulty of specifying an appropriate target distribution for the agent. This paper introduces two solutions that work in concert to address these limitations. First, we present a novel planning algorithm for finite temporal horizons with drastically lower computational complexity. Second, inspired by Z-learning from control theory literature, we simplify the process of setting an appropriate target distribution for new and existing active inference planning schemes. Our first approach leverages the dynamic programming algorithm, known for its computational efficiency, to minimize the cost function used in planning through the Bellman-optimality principle. Accordingly, our algorithm recursively assesses the expected free energy of actions in the reverse temporal order. This improves computational efficiency by orders of magnitude and allows precise model learning and planning, even under uncertain conditions. Our method simplifies the planning process and shows meaningful behaviour even when specifying only the agent's final goal state. The proposed solutions make defining a target distribution from a goal state straightforward compared to the more complicated task of defining a temporally informed target distribution. The effectiveness of these methods is tested and demonstrated through simulations in standard grid-world tasks. These advances create new opportunities for various applications.",

      "abstract": "Humans perceive and interact with hundreds of objects every day. In doing so, they need to employ mental models of these objects and often exploit symmetries in the object's shape and appearance in order to learn generalizable and transferable skills. Active inference is a first principles approach to understanding and modeling sentient agents. It states that agents entertain a generative model of their environment, and learn and act by minimizing an upper bound on their surprisal, i.e. their Free Energy. The Free Energy decomposes into an accuracy and complexity term, meaning that agents favor the least complex model, that can accurately explain their sensory observations. In this paper, we investigate how inherent symmetries of particular objects also emerge as symmetries in the latent state space of the generative model learnt under deep active inference. In particular, we focus on object-centric representations, which are trained from pixels to predict novel object views as the agent moves its viewpoint. First, we investigate the relation between model complexity and symmetry exploitation in the state space. Second, we do a principal component analysis to demonstrate how the model encodes the principal axis of symmetry of the object in the latent space. Finally, we also demonstrate how more symmetrical representations can be exploited for better generalization in the context of manipulation.",

This results in a scheme that simultaneously adapts both high-level actions and low-level motions. The AIP generates alternative symbolic plans, each linked to a cost function for M3P2I. The latter employs a physics simulator for diverse trajectory rollouts, deriving optimal control by weighing the different samples according to their cost. This idea enables blending different robot skills for fluid and reactive plan execution, accommodating plan adjustments at both the high and low levels to cope, for instance, with dynamic obstacles or disturbances that invalidate the current plan.

This approach relies on identifiable environmental features (topological landmarks) in tandem with estimations of distance and direction (coarse-grained path integration) to construct cognitive maps of the surroundings. This cognitive map is believed to exhibit a hierarchical structure, allowing efficient planning when solving complex navigation tasks. Inspired by human behaviour, this paper presents a scalable hierarchical active inference model for autonomous navigation, exploration, and goal-oriented behaviour. The model uses visual observation and motion perception to combine curiosity-driven exploration with goal-oriented behaviour. Motion is planned using different levels of reasoning, i.e., from context to place to motion. This allows for efficient navigation in new spaces and rapid progress toward a target. By incorporating these human navigational strategies and their hierarchical representation of the environment, this model proposes a new solution for autonomous navigation and exploration.

Through collaboration, they (3) increase the scope of SLO fulfillment. We implemented the framework and evaluated a use case in which a CC system is responsible for ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) during video streaming. Our results showed that edge devices required only ten training rounds to ensure four SLOs; furthermore, the underlying causal structures were also rationally explainable. The addition of new types of devices can be done a posteriori, the framework allowed them to reuse existing models, even though the device type had been unknown. Finally, rebalancing the load within a device cluster allowed individual edge devices to recover their SLO compliance after a network failure from 22% to 89%.",

In OA-CMABs, external observations are a function of context features and thus provide evidence on top of observed option outcomes to infer hidden parameters. However, if external data is error-prone, measures must be taken to preserve the correctness of inference. To this end, we derive a robust Bayesian inference process for OA-CMABs based on recently developed probabilistic semantic data association techniques, which handle complex mixture model parameter priors and hybrid discrete-continuous observation likelihoods for semantic external data sources. To cope with combined uncertainties in OA-CMABs, we also derive a new active inference algorithm for optimal option selection based on approximate expected free energy minimization. This generalizes prior work on CMAB active inference by accounting for faulty observations and non-Gaussian distributions. Results for a simulated deep space search site selection problem show that, even if incorrect semantic observations are provided externally, e.g. by scientists, efficient decision-making and robust parameter inference are still achieved in a wide variety of conditions.",

      "abstract": "Collective motion is ubiquitous in nature; groups of animals, such as fish, birds, and ungulates appear to move as a whole, exhibiting a rich behavioral repertoire that ranges from directed movement to milling to disordered swarming. Typically, such macroscopic patterns arise from decentralized, local interactions among constituent components (e.g., individual fish in a school). Preeminent models of this process describe individuals as self-propelled particles, subject to self-generated motion and 'social forces' such as short-range repulsion and long-range attraction or alignment. However, organisms are not particles; they are probabilistic decision-makers. Here, we introduce an approach to modelling collective behavior based on active inference. This cognitive framework casts behavior as the consequence of a single imperative: to minimize surprise. We demonstrate that many empirically-observed collective phenomena, including cohesion, milling and directed motion, emerge naturally when considering behavior as driven by active Bayesian inference -- without explicitly building behavioral rules or goals into individual agents. Furthermore, we show that active inference can recover and generalize the classical notion of social forces as agents attempt to suppress prediction errors that conflict with their expectations. By exploring the parameter space of the belief-based model, we reveal non-trivial relationships between the individual beliefs and group properties like polarization and the tendency to visit different collective states. We also explore how individual beliefs about uncertainty determine collective decision-making accuracy. Finally, we show how agents can update their generative model over time, resulting in groups that are collectively more sensitive to external fluctuations and encode information more robustly.",

Imbuing world models with a group structure may capture different agents' spatial awareness and affordance schemes. We used group action as a special class of policies for perspective-dependent control. We explored how such geometric structure impacts agents' behavior, comparing how the Euclidean versus projective groups act on epistemic value in active inference, drive curiosity, and exploration behaviors. We formally demonstrate and simulate how the groups induce distinct behaviors in a simple search task. The projective group's nonlinear magnification of information transformed epistemic value according to the choice of frame, generating behaviors of approach toward an object of interest. The projective group structure within the agent's world model contains the Projective Consciousness Model, which is know to capture key features of consciousness. On the other hand, the Euclidean group had no effect on epistemic value : no action was better than the initial idle state. In structuring a priori an agent's internal representation, we show how geometry can play a key role in information integration and action planning.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a variational formulation of natural selection, paying special attention to the nature of \"things\" and the way that different \"kinds\" of \"things\" are individuated from - and influence - each other. We use the Bayesian mechanics of particular partitions to understand how slow phylogenetic processes constrain - and are constrained by - fast, phenotypic processes. The main result is a formulation of adaptive fitness as a path integral of phenotypic fitness. Paths of least action, at the phenotypic and phylogenetic scales, can then be read as inference and learning processes, respectively. In this view, a phenotype actively infers the state of its econiche under a generative model, whose parameters are learned via natural (bayesian model selection). The ensuing variational synthesis features some unexpected aspects. Perhaps the most notable is that it is not possible to describe or model a population of conspecifics per se. Rather, it is necessary to consider populations - and nested meta-populations - of different natural kinds that influence each other. This paper is limited to a description of the mathematical apparatus and accompanying ideas. Subsequent work will use these methods for simulations and numerical analyses - and identify points of contact with related mathematical formulations of evolution.",

On this purpose, we modeled perception processes of continuous sensory sequences using our previous proposed variational RNN model which was developed based on the free energy principle. The current study extended this model by introducing an adaptation mechanism of a meta-level parameter, referred to as the meta-prior $\\mathbf{w}$, which regulates the complexity term in the free energy. Our simulation experiments demonstrated that autonomous shifts between focused perception and mind-wandering take place when $\\mathbf{w}$ switches between low and high values associated with decrease and increase of the average reconstruction error over the past window.

Using methods from classical mechanics on manifolds, we define a kinetic energy term using the Fisher metric on distributions and a potential energy function defined in terms of stress on the agents' beliefs. The resulting Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) produces a variation of the classic DeGroot dynamics. In the two agent case, the potential function is defined using the Jeffrey's divergence and the resulting dynamics are characterized by a non-linear spring. These dynamics produce trajectories that resemble flows on tori but are shown numerically to produce chaos near the boundary of the space. We then investigate persuasion as an information theoretic control problem where analysis indicates that manipulating peer pressure with a fixed target is a more stable approach to altering an agent's belief than providing a slowly changing belief state that approaches the target.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, cognition has been considered a uniquely human capability involving perception, memory, learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. However, recent research shows that cognition is a fundamental ability shared by all living beings, from single cells to complex organisms. This chapter takes an info-computational approach (ICON), viewing natural structures as information and the processes of change in these structures as computations. It is a relational framework dependent on the perspective of a cognizing observer/cognizer. Informational structures are properties of the material substrate, and when focusing on the behavior of the substrate, we discuss morphological computing (MC). ICON and MC are complementary perspectives for a cognizer. Information and computation are inseparably connected with cognition. This chapter explores research connecting nature as a computational structure for a cognizer, with morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, extended cognition, and extended evolutionary synthesis, using examples of the free energy principle and active inference. It introduces theoretical and practical approaches challenging traditional computational models of cognition limited to abstract symbol processing, highlighting the computational capacities inherent in the material substrate (embodiment). Understanding the embodiment of cognition through its morphological computational basis is crucial for biology, evolution, intelligence theory, AI, robotics, and other fields.",

While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.",

In this paper, we show that any type of behaviour complying with physically sound assumptions about how macroscopic biological agents interact with the world canonically integrates exploration and exploitation in the sense of minimising risk and ambiguity about states of the world. This description, known as active inference, refines the free energy principle, a popular descriptive framework for action and perception originating in neuroscience. Active inference provides a normative Bayesian framework to simulate and model agency that is widely used in behavioural neuroscience, reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. The usefulness of active inference for RL is three-fold. \\emph{a}) Active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma that usefully simulates biological agency. \\emph{b}) It provides an explainable recipe to simulate behaviour, whence behaviour follows as an explainable mixture of exploration and exploitation under a generative world model, and all differences in behaviour are explicit in differences in world model. \\emph{c}) This framework is universal in the sense that it is theoretically possible to rewrite any RL algorithm conforming to the descriptive assumptions of active inference as an active inference algorithm. Thus, active inference can be used as a tool to uncover and compare the commitments and assumptions of more specific models of agency.",

      "abstract": "We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, the free energy principle (FEP) and active inference (AIF) have achieved many successes connecting conceptual models of learning and cognition to mathematical models of perception and action. This effort is driven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of self-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various reinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been proposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent work has focused on improving such agents' performance in complex environments by incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we take an alternative approach. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we attempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by introducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards only, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable environments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a given task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free energy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced to deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous hidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired from behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid. Our results show that FEPS agents fully resolve the ambiguity of both environments by appropriately contextualizing their observations based on prediction accuracy only. In addition, they infer optimal policies flexibly for any target observation in the environment.",

      "abstract": "As synthetic content increasingly infiltrates the web, generative AI models may be retrained on their own outputs: a process termed \"autophagy\". This leads to model collapse: a progressive loss of performance and diversity across generations. Recent studies have examined the emergence of model collapse across various generative AI models and data types, and have proposed mitigation strategies that rely on incorporating human-authored content. However, current characterizations of model collapse remain limited, and existing mitigation methods assume reliable knowledge of whether training data is human-authored or AI-generated. In this paper, we address these gaps by introducing new measures that characterise collapse directly from a model's next-token probability distributions, rather than from properties of AI-generated text. Using these measures, we show that the degree of collapse depends on the complexity of the initial training set, as well as on the extent of autophagy. Our experiments prompt a new suggestion: that model collapse occurs when a model trains on data that does not \"surprise\" it. We express this hypothesis in terms of the well-known Free Energy Principle in cognitive science. Building on this insight, we propose a practical mitigation strategy: filtering training items by high surplexity, maximising the surprise of the model. Unlike existing methods, this approach does not require distinguishing between human- and AI-generated data. Experiments across datasets and models demonstrate that our strategy is at least as effective as human-data baselines, and even more effective in reducing distributional skewedness. Our results provide a richer understanding of model collapse and point toward more resilient approaches for training generative AI systems in environments increasingly saturated with synthetic data.",

In this paper we want to make the distinction between robot's internal and external worlds clear-cut. Can the robot learn about its environment, relying only on internally available information, including the sensor data? Are there mathematical conditions on the internal robot system which can be internally verified and make the robot's internal system mirror the structure of the environment? We prove that sufficiency is such a mathematical principle, and mathematically describe the emergence of the robot's internal structure isomorphic or bisimulation equivalent to that of the environment. A connection to the free-energy principle is established, when sufficiency is interpreted as a limit case of surprise minimization. As such, we show that surprise minimization leads to having an internal model isomorphic to the environment. This also parallels the Good Regulator Principle which states that controlling a system sufficiently well means having a model of it.

The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions, is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced significantly by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuo-motor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience.",

      "abstract": "An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this functional integration of discrete and continuous variables during decision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston & de Vries, 2017; Parr & Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive physical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed generative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how this framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel hierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete active inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference controller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete representations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS inform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and successful planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.",

      "abstract": "In nature, active inference agents must learn how observations of the world represent the state of the agent. In engineering, the physics behind sensors is often known reasonably accurately and measurement functions can be incorporated into generative models. When a measurement function is non-linear, the transformed variable is typically approximated with a Gaussian distribution to ensure tractable inference. We show that Gaussian approximations that are sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, such as a second-order Taylor approximation, produce a state-dependent ambiguity term. This induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation. We demonstrate this preference with a robot navigation experiment where agents plan trajectories.",

We cast generative models formally as systems \"on an interface\", with the latter being a compositional abstraction of the usual notion of Markov blanket; agents are then 'controllers' for their generative models, formally dual to them. This opens the active inference landscape to new horizons, such as: agents with structured interfaces (e.g. with 'mode-dependence', or that interact with computer APIs); agents that can manage other agents; and 'meta-agents', that use active inference to change their (internal or external) structure. With structured interfaces, we also gain structured ('typed') policies, which are amenable to formal verification, an important step towards safe artificial agents. Moreover, we can make use of categorical logic to describe express agents' goals as formal predicates, whose satisfaction may be dependent on the interaction context. This points towards powerful compositional tools to constrain and control self-organizing ensembles of agents.",

A recent paradigm, active inference, brings fundamental insights into the adaptation of biological organisms, constantly striving to minimize prediction errors to restrict themselves to life-compatible states. Over the past years, many studies have shown how human and animal behaviors could be explained in terms of active inference - either as discrete decision-making or continuous motor control - inspiring innovative solutions in robotics and artificial intelligence. Still, the literature lacks a comprehensive outlook on effectively planning realistic actions in changing environments. Setting ourselves the goal of modeling complex tasks such as tool use, we delve into the topic of dynamic planning in active inference, keeping in mind two crucial aspects of biological behavior: the capacity to understand and exploit affordances for object manipulation, and to learn the hierarchical interactions between the self and the environment, including other agents. We start from a simple unit and gradually describe more advanced structures, comparing recently proposed design choices and providing basic examples. This study distances itself from traditional views centered on neural networks and reinforcement learning, and points toward a yet unexplored direction in active inference: hybrid representations in hierarchical models.",

In normal active inference, the Markov Blanket is defined starting from the agent. That is, first the agent was defined as the entity that performs the \"action\" such as a robot or a person, then the environment was defined as other people or objects that are directly affected by the agent's \"action,\" and the boundary between the agent and the environment was defined as the Markov Blanket. This agent-centric definition does not allow the agent to respond to unintended changes in the environment caused by factors outside of the defined environment. In the proposed EC-AIF, there is no entity corresponding to an agent. The environment includes all observable things, including people and things conventionally considered to be the environment, as well as entities that perform \"actions\" such as robots and people. Accordingly, all states, including robots and people, are included in inference targets, eliminating unintended changes in the environment. The EC-AIF was applied to a robot arm and validated with an object transport task by the robot arm. The results showed that the robot arm successfully transported objects while responding to changes in the target position of the object and to changes in the orientation of another robot arm.",

Building on our previous work exploring the relationship between active inference, well-being, resilience, and sustainability, we present a computational model of an agent learning sustainable resource management strategies in both static and dynamic environments. The agent's behavior emerges from optimizing its own well-being, represented by prior preferences, subject to beliefs about environmental dynamics. In a static environment, the agent learns to consistently consume resources to satisfy its needs. In a dynamic environment where resources deplete and replenish based on the agent's actions, the agent adapts its behavior to balance immediate needs with long-term resource availability. This demonstrates how active inference can give rise to sustainable and resilient behaviors in the face of changing environmental conditions. We discuss the implications of our model, its limitations, and suggest future directions for integrating more complex agent-environment interactions.

Traditional autonomous driving systems rely heavily on Modular Pipelines, Imitation Learning, or Reinforcement Learning, each with inherent limitations in adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. Active inference addresses these challenges by minimizing prediction error (termed \"surprise\") through a dynamic model that balances perception and action. Our method integrates active inference with deep learning to manage lateral control in AVs, enabling them to perform lane following maneuvers within a simulated urban environment. We demonstrate that our model, despite its simplicity, effectively learns and generalizes from limited data without extensive retraining, significantly reducing computational demands. The proposed approach not only enhances the adaptability and performance of AVs in dynamic scenarios but also aligns closely with human-like driving behavior, leveraging a generative model to predict and adapt to environmental changes. Results from extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show promising outcomes, outperforming traditional methods in terms of adaptability and efficiency, thereby advancing the potential of active inference in real-world autonomous driving applications.",

Here, we take a different approach: starting with active inference, a first principles framework for modelling behaviour as (approximate) Bayesian inference, and building up to a minimal theory of consciousness, which emerges from the shared features of computational models derived under active inference.

In this paper, we present a continual learning framework for agents operating in discrete time environments, using active inference as the foundation. We derive the mathematical formulations of variational and expected free energy and apply them to the design of a self-learning research agent. This agent updates its beliefs and adapts its actions based on new data without manual intervention.

Additionally, less work exists in examining the most difficult form of POMDP-centered control: continuous action space POMDPs under sparse reward signals. In this work, we address issues facing the AIF modeling paradigm by introducing novel prior preference learning techniques and self-revision schedules to help the agent excel in sparse-reward, continuous action, goal-based robotic control POMDP environments. Empirically, we show that our agents offer improved performance over state-of-the-art models in terms of cumulative rewards, relative stability, and success rate.

      "abstract": "Allostasis proposes that long-term viability of a living system is achieved through anticipatory adjustments of its physiology and behaviour: emphasising physiological and affective stress as an adaptive state of adaptation that minimizes long-term prediction errors. More recently, the active inference framework (AIF) has also sought to explain action and long-term adaptation through the minimization of future errors (free energy), through the learning of statistical contingencies of the world, offering a formalism for allostatic regulation. We suggest that framing prediction errors through the lens of biological hormonal dynamics proposed by allostasis offers a way to integrate these two models together in a biologically-plausible manner. In this paper, we describe our initial work in developing a model that grounds prediction errors (surprisal) into the secretion of a physiological stress hormone (cortisol) acting as an adaptive, allostatic mediator on a homeostatically-controlled physiology. We evaluate this using a computational model in simulations using an active inference agent endowed with an artificial physiology, regulated through homeostatic and allostatic control in a stochastic environment. Our results find that allostatic functions of cortisol (stress), secreted as a function of prediction errors, provide adaptive advantages to the agent's long-term physiological regulation. We argue that the coupling of information-theoretic prediction errors to low-level, biological hormonal dynamics of stress can provide a computationally efficient model to long-term regulation for embodied intelligent systems.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a discrete state-space model -- and accompanying methods -- for generative modelling. This model generalises partially observed Markov decision processes to include paths as latent variables, rendering it suitable for active inference and learning in a dynamic setting. Specifically, we consider deep or hierarchical forms using the renormalisation group. The ensuing renormalising generative models (RGM) can be regarded as discrete homologues of deep convolutional neural networks or continuous state-space models in generalised coordinates of motion. By construction, these scale-invariant models can be used to learn compositionality over space and time, furnishing models of paths or orbits; i.e., events of increasing temporal depth and itinerancy. This technical note illustrates the automatic discovery, learning and deployment of RGMs using a series of applications. We start with image classification and then consider the compression and generation of movies and music. Finally, we apply the same variational principles to the learning of Atari-like games.",

This becomes more difficult in uncertain environments with stochastic outcomes. Enhancing transparency in the robot's behavior and aligning with user preferences are also crucial. This paper introduces a novel framework for multi-objective reinforcement learning that ensures safe task execution, optimizes trade-offs between objectives, and adheres to user preferences. The framework has two main layers: a multi-objective task planner and a high-level selector. The planning layer generates a set of optimal trade-off plans that guarantee satisfaction of a temporal logic task. The selector uses active inference to decide which generated plan best complies with user preferences and aids learning. Operating iteratively, the framework updates a parameterized learning model based on collected data. Case studies and benchmarks on both manipulation and mobile robots show that our framework outperforms other methods and (i) learns multiple optimal trade-offs, (ii) adheres to a user preference, and (iii) allows the user to adjust the balance between (i) and (ii).",

      "abstract": "Understanding how individual agents make strategic decisions within collectives is important for advancing fields as diverse as economics, neuroscience, and multi-agent systems. Two complementary approaches can be integrated to this end. The Active Inference framework (AIF) describes how agents employ a generative model to adapt their beliefs about and behaviour within their environment. Game theory formalises strategic interactions between agents with potentially competing objectives. To bridge the gap between the two, we propose a factorisation of the generative model whereby each agent maintains explicit, individual-level beliefs about the internal states of other agents, and uses them for strategic planning in a joint context. We apply our model to iterated general-sum games with two and three players, and study the ensemble effects of game transitions, where the agents' preferences (game payoffs) change over time. This non-stationarity, beyond that caused by reciprocal adaptation, reflects a more naturalistic environment in which agents need to adapt to changing social contexts. Finally, we present a dynamical analysis of key AIF quantities: the variational free energy (VFE) and the expected free energy (EFE) from numerical simulation data. The ensemble-level EFE allows us to characterise the basins of attraction of games with multiple Nash Equilibria under different conditions, and we find that it is not necessarily minimised at the aggregate level. By integrating AIF and game theory, we can gain deeper insights into how intelligent collectives emerge, learn, and optimise their actions in dynamic environments, both cooperative and non-cooperative.",

      "abstract": "The current scenario of IoT is witnessing a constant increase on the volume of data, which is generated in constant stream, calling for novel architectural and logical solutions for processing it. Moving the data handling towards the edge of the computing spectrum guarantees better distribution of load and, in principle, lower latency and better privacy. However, managing such a structure is complex, especially when requirements, also referred to Service Level Objectives (SLOs), specified by applications' owners and infrastructure managers need to be ensured. Despite the rich number of proposals of Machine Learning (ML) based management solutions, researchers and practitioners yet struggle to guarantee long-term prediction and control, and accurate troubleshooting. Therefore, we present a novel ML paradigm based on Active Inference (AIF) -- a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We implement it and evaluate it in a heterogeneous real stream processing use case, where an AIF-based agent continuously optimizes the fulfillment of three SLOs for three autonomous driving services running on multiple devices. The agent used causal knowledge to gradually develop an understanding of how its actions are related to requirements fulfillment, and which configurations to favor. Through this approach, our agent requires up to thirty iterations to converge to the optimal solution, showing the capability of offering accurate results in a short amount of time. Furthermore, thanks to AIF and its causal structures, our method guarantees full transparency on the decision making, making the interpretation of the results and the troubleshooting effortless.",

      "abstract": "Handling heterogeneity and unpredictability are two core problems in pervasive computing. The challenge is to seamlessly integrate devices with varying computational resources in a dynamic environment to form a cohesive system that can fulfill the needs of all participants. Existing work on adaptive systems typically focuses on optimizing individual variables or low-level Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as constraining the usage of specific resources. While low-level control mechanisms permit fine-grained control over a system, they introduce considerable complexity, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we propose drawing from Active Inference (AIF), a neuroscientific framework for designing adaptive agents. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual agent for heterogeneous pervasive systems that permits setting global systems constraints as high-level SLOs. Instead of manually setting low-level SLOs, the system finds an equilibrium that can adapt to environmental changes. We demonstrate the viability of our AIF agents with an extensive experiment design, using heterogeneous and lifelong federated learning as an application scenario. We conduct our experiments on a physical testbed of devices with different resource types and vendor specifications. The results provide convincing evidence that an AIF agent can adapt a system to environmental changes. In particular, the AIF agent can balance competing SLOs in resource heterogeneous environments to ensure up to 98% fulfillment rate.",

Drawing on theories from neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and AI research, we justify the use of functionalism and examine the model's architecture using frameworks like Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and active inference. The paper also investigates how RLHF influences the model's internal reasoning processes, potentially giving rise to consciousness-like experiences.

      "abstract": "Continuing advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) in artificial intelligence offer important capacities in intuitively accessing and using medical knowledge in many contexts, including education and training as well as assessment and treatment. Most of the initial literature on LLMs in medicine has emphasized that LLMs are unsuitable for medical use because they are non-deterministic, may provide incorrect or harmful responses, and cannot be regulated to assure quality control. If these issues could be corrected, optimizing LLM technology could benefit patients and physicians by providing affordable, point-of-care medical knowledge. Our proposed framework refines LLM responses by restricting their primary knowledge base to domain-specific datasets containing validated medical information. Additionally, we introduce an actor-critic LLM prompting protocol based on active inference principles of human cognition, where a Therapist agent initially responds to patient queries, and a Supervisor agent evaluates and adjusts responses to ensure accuracy and reliability. We conducted a validation study where expert cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) therapists evaluated responses from the LLM in a blind format. Experienced human CBT-I therapists assessed responses to 100 patient queries, comparing LLM-generated responses with appropriate and inappropriate responses crafted by experienced CBT-I therapists. Results showed that LLM responses received high ratings from the CBT-I therapists, often exceeding those of therapist-generated appropriate responses. This structured approach aims to integrate advanced LLM technology into medical applications, meeting regulatory requirements for establishing the safe and effective use of special purpose validated LLMs in medicine.",

It operates on a simple yet powerful intuition: prioritize the collection of labels for data points where the model exhibits uncertainty, and rely on the model's predictions where it is confident. Active inference constructs provably valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests while leveraging any black-box machine learning model and handling any data distribution. The key point is that it achieves the same level of accuracy with far fewer samples than existing baselines relying on non-adaptively-collected data. This means that for the same number of collected samples, active inference enables smaller confidence intervals and more powerful p-values.

Next, we briefly survey three dimensions of symbolic identification (sociological, psychoanalytic, and linguistical) and corresponding active inference accounts. To provide intuition, we respectively employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) supervised by ChatGPT to showcase optimization of free energy during motor skill and language mastery underlying identification formation. We then introduce Lacan's Graph II of desire, unifying imaginary and symbolic identification, and propose an illustrative model called FreeAgent. In concluding remarks, we discuss some key issues in the potential of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis to advance mental health and artificial intelligence, including digital twin mind, large language models as avatars of the Lacanian Other, and the feasibility of human-level artificial general intelligence with self-awareness in the context of post-structuralism.",

      "abstract": "Doppler ultrasound is widely used to monitor fetal heart rate during labor and pregnancy. Unfortunately, it is highly sensitive to fetal and maternal movements, which can cause the displacement of the fetal heart with respect to the ultrasound beam, in turn reducing the Doppler signal-to-noise ratio and leading to erratic, noisy, or missing heart rate readings. To tackle this issue, we augment the conventional Doppler ultrasound system with a rational agent that autonomously steers the ultrasound beam to track the position of the fetal heart. The proposed cognitive ultrasound system leverages a sequential Monte Carlo method to infer the fetal heart position from the power Doppler signal, and employs a greedy information-seeking criterion to select the steering angle that minimizes the positional uncertainty for future timesteps. The fetal heart rate is then calculated using the Doppler signal at the estimated fetal heart position. Our results show that the system can accurately track the fetal heart position across challenging signal-to-noise ratio scenarios, mainly thanks to its dynamic transmit beam steering capability. Additionally, we find that optimizing the transmit beamsteering to minimize positional uncertainty also optimizes downstream heart rate estimation performance. In conclusion, this work showcases the power of closed-loop cognitive ultrasound in boosting the capabilities of traditional systems.",

Active inference is based on the expected free energy, which is mostly justified by the intuitive plausibility of its formulations, e.g., the risk plus ambiguity and information gain / pragmatic value formulations. This paper seek to formalize the problem of deriving these formulations from a single root expected free energy definition, i.e., the unification problem. Then, we study two settings, each one having its own root expected free energy definition. In the first setting, no justification for the expected free energy has been proposed to date, but all the formulations can be recovered from it. However, in this setting, the agent cannot have arbitrary prior preferences over observations. Indeed, only a limited class of prior preferences over observations is compatible with the likelihood mapping of the generative model. In the second setting, a justification of the root expected free energy definition is known, but this setting only accounts for two formulations, i.e., the risk over states plus ambiguity and entropy plus expected energy formulations.",

      "abstract": "To determine an optimal plan for complex tasks, one often deals with dynamic and hierarchical relationships between several entities. Traditionally, such problems are tackled with optimal control, which relies on the optimization of cost functions; instead, a recent biologically-motivated proposal casts planning and control as an inference process. Active inference assumes that action and perception are two complementary aspects of life whereby the role of the former is to fulfill the predictions inferred by the latter. Here, we present an active inference approach that exploits discrete and continuous processing, based on three features: the representation of potential body configurations in relation to the objects of interest; the use of hierarchical relationships that enable the agent to easily interpret and flexibly expand its body schema for tool use; the definition of potential trajectories related to the agent's intentions, used to infer and plan with dynamic elements at different temporal scales. We evaluate this deep hybrid model on a habitual task: reaching a moving object after having picked a moving tool. We show that the model can tackle the presented task under different conditions. This study extends past work on planning as inference and advances an alternative direction to optimal control.",

      "abstract": "The emergence and growth of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) networks has brought about the rise of so-called ''programmable'' networks, i.e., networks whose operational requirements are so stringent that they can only be met in an automated manner, with minimal/no human involvement. Any requirements on such a network would need to be formally specified via intents, which can represent user requirements in a formal yet understandable manner. Meeting the user requirements via intents would necessitate the rapid implementation of resource allocation and scheduling in the network. Also, given the expected size and geographical distribution of programmable networks, multiple resource scheduling implementations would need to be implemented at the same time. This would necessitate the use of a meta-scheduler that can coordinate the various schedulers and dynamically ensure optimal resource scheduling across the network.   To that end, in this position paper, we propose a research agenda for modeling, implementation, and inclusion of intent-based dynamic meta-scheduling in programmable networks. Our research agenda will be built on active inference, a type of causal inference. Active inference provides some level of autonomy to each scheduler while the meta-scheduler takes care of overall intent fulfillment. Our research agenda will comprise a strawman architecture for meta-scheduling and a set of research questions that need to be addressed to make intent-based dynamic meta-scheduling a reality.",

We show how one can derive a valence and arousal signal from an agent's expected free energy, relating arousal to the entropy of posterior beliefs and valence to utility less expected utility. Under this formulation, we simulate artificial agents engaged in a search task. We show that the manipulation of priors and object presence results in commonsense variability in emotional states.",

      "abstract": "Organisms have to keep track of the information in the environment that is relevant for adaptive behaviour. Transmitting information in an economical and efficient way becomes crucial for limited-resourced agents living in high-dimensional environments. The efficient coding hypothesis claims that organisms seek to maximize the information about the sensory input in an efficient manner. Under Bayesian inference, this means that the role of the brain is to efficiently allocate resources in order to make predictions about the hidden states that cause sensory data. However, neither of those frameworks accounts for how that information is exploited downstream, leaving aside the action-oriented role of the perceptual system. Rate-distortion theory, which defines optimal lossy compression under constraints, has gained attention as a formal framework to explore goal-oriented efficient coding. In this work, we explore action-centric representations in the context of rate-distortion theory. We also provide a mathematical definition of abstractions and we argue that, as a summary of the relevant details, they can be used to fix the content of action-centric representations. We model action-centric representations using VAEs and we find that such representations i) are efficient lossy compressions of the data; ii) capture the task-dependent invariances necessary to achieve successful behaviour; and iii) are not in service of reconstructing the data. Thus, we conclude that full reconstruction of the data is rarely needed to achieve optimal behaviour, consistent with a teleological approach to perception.",

      "abstract": "Neuroimaging data, particularly from techniques like MRI or PET, offer rich but complex information about brain structure and activity. To manage this complexity, latent representation models - such as Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) - are increasingly applied. These models are designed to reduce high-dimensional neuroimaging data to lower-dimensional latent spaces, where key patterns and variations related to brain function can be identified. By modeling these latent spaces, researchers hope to gain insights into the biology and function of the brain, including how its structure changes with age or disease, or how it encodes sensory information, predicts and adapts to new inputs. This review discusses how these models are used for clinical applications, like disease diagnosis and progression monitoring, but also for exploring fundamental brain mechanisms such as active inference and predictive coding. These approaches provide a powerful tool for both understanding and simulating the brain's complex computational tasks, potentially advancing our knowledge of cognition, perception, and neural disorders.",

Previous work has demonstrated that a class of hybrid state-space model known as recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) discover meaningful behavioural units via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). Furthermore, they model how the underlying continuous states drive these discrete mode switches. We propose that the rich representations formed by an rSLDS can provide useful abstractions for planning and control. We present a novel hierarchical model-based algorithm inspired by Active Inference in which a discrete MDP sits above a low-level linear-quadratic controller. The recurrent transition dynamics learned by the rSLDS allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We successfully apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and non-trivial planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to place Lorenzo Magnanis Eco-Cognitive Computationalism within the broader context of current work on information, computation, and cognition. Traditionally, cognition was believed to be exclusive to humans and a result of brain activity. However, recent studies reveal it as a fundamental characteristic of all life forms, ranging from single cells to complex multicellular organisms and their networks. Yet, the literature and general understanding of cognition still largely remain human-brain-focused, leading to conceptual gaps and incoherency. This paper presents a variety of computational (information processing) approaches, including an info-computational approach to cognition, where natural structures represent information and dynamical processes on natural structures are regarded as computation, relative to an observing cognizing agent. We model cognition as a web of concurrent morphological computations, driven by processes of self-assembly, self-organisation, and autopoiesis across physical, chemical, and biological domains. We examine recent findings linking morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, basal cognition, extended evolutionary synthesis, and active inference. We establish a connection to Magnanis Eco-Cognitive Computationalism and the idea of computational domestication of ignorant entities. Novel theoretical and applied insights question the boundaries of conventional computational models of cognition. The traditional models prioritize symbolic processing and often neglect the inherent constraints and potentialities in the physical embodiment of agents on different levels of organization. Gaining a better info-computational grasp of cognitive embodiment is crucial for the advancement of fields such as biology, evolutionary studies, artificial intelligence, robotics, medicine, and more.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters have sparked a new wave of exciting AI applications. However, their high computational costs and memory demands during inference pose significant challenges. Adaptive sparse activation inference, which activates only a small number of neurons for each token, offers a novel way to accelerate model inference without degrading performance, showing great potential for resource-constrained hardware devices. Nevertheless, existing methods predict activated neurons based on individual tokens with additional MLP, which involve frequent changes in activation maps and resource calls, limiting the acceleration benefits of sparse activation. In this paper, we introduce CoreInfer, an MLP-free adaptive sparse activation inference method based on sentence-level prediction. Specifically, we propose the concept of sentence-wise core neurons, which refers to the subset of neurons most critical for a given sentence, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness. To determine the core neurons, we explore the correlation between core neurons and the sentence's semantics. Remarkably, we discovered that core neurons exhibit both stability and similarity in relation to the sentence's semantics -- an insight overlooked by previous studies. Building on this finding, we further design two semantic-based methods for predicting core neurons to fit different input scenarios. In CoreInfer, the core neurons are determined during the pre-filling stage and fixed during the encoding stage, enabling zero-cost sparse inference. We evaluated the model generalization and task generalization of CoreInfer across various models and tasks. Notably, on an NVIDIA TITAN XP GPU, CoreInfer achieved a 10.33 times and 2.72 times speedup compared to the Huggingface implementation and PowerInfer, respectively.",

Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.",

Foundation models pre-trained on enormous amounts of data have shown remarkable generalization skills through prompting, particularly in zero-shot inference. However, their performance is restricted to the correctness of the target label's search space. In an open world, this target search space can be unknown or exceptionally large, which severely restricts the performance of such models. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework called ALGO - Action Learning with Grounded Object recognition that uses symbolic knowledge stored in large-scale knowledge bases to infer activities in egocentric videos with limited supervision using two steps. First, we propose a neuro-symbolic prompting approach that uses object-centric vision-language models as a noisy oracle to ground objects in the video through evidence-based reasoning. Second, driven by prior commonsense knowledge, we discover plausible activities through an energy-based symbolic pattern theory framework and learn to ground knowledge-based action (verb) concepts in the video. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets (EPIC-Kitchens, GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze Plus) demonstrate its performance on open-world activity inference.",

      "abstract": "The Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT), a notable segment within the IoT domain, involves the integration of IoT technology into consumer electronics and devices, such as smart homes and smart wearables. Compared to traditional IoT fields, CIoT differs notably in target users, product types, and design approaches. While offering convenience to users, it also raises new security and privacy concerns. Network traffic analysis, a widely used technique in the security community, has been extensively applied to investigate these concerns about CIoT. Compared to traditional network traffic analysis in fields like mobile apps and websites, CIoT introduces unique characteristics that pose new challenges and research opportunities. Researchers have made significant contributions in this area. To aid researchers in understanding the application of traffic analysis tools for assessing CIoT security and privacy risks, this survey reviews 310 publications on traffic analysis within the CIoT security and privacy domain from January 2018 to June 2024, focusing on three research questions. Our work: 1) outlines the CIoT traffic analysis process and highlights its differences from general network traffic analysis. 2) summarizes and classifies existing research into four categories according to its application objectives: device fingerprinting, user activity inference, malicious traffic detection, and measurement. 3) explores emerging challenges and potential future research directions based on each step of the CIoT traffic analysis process. This will provide new insights to the community and guide the industry towards safer product designs.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to introduce a field of study that has emerged over the last decade called Bayesian mechanics. Bayesian mechanics is a probabilistic mechanics, comprising tools that enable us to model systems endowed with a particular partition (i.e., into particles), where the internal states (or the trajectories of internal states) of a particular system encode the parameters of beliefs about external states (or their trajectories). These tools allow us to write down mechanical theories for systems that look as if they are estimating posterior probability distributions over the causes of their sensory states. This provides a formal language for modelling the constraints, forces, potentials, and other quantities determining the dynamics of such systems, especially as they entail dynamics on a space of beliefs (i.e., on a statistical manifold). Here, we will review the state of the art in the literature on the free energy principle, distinguishing between three ways in which Bayesian mechanics has been applied to particular systems (i.e., path-tracking, mode-tracking, and mode-matching). We go on to examine a duality between the free energy principle and the constrained maximum entropy principle, both of which lie at the heart of Bayesian mechanics, and discuss its implications.",

The ensuing account expresses the paths or trajectories that a particle takes as it evolves over time. The main results are a method or principle of least action that can be used to emulate the behaviour of particles in open exchange with their external milieu. Particles are defined by a particular partition, in which internal states are individuated from external states by active and sensory blanket states. The variational principle at hand allows one to interpret internal dynamics - of certain kinds of particles - as inferring external states that are hidden behind blanket states. We consider different kinds of particles, and to what extent they can be imbued with an elementary form of inference or sentience. Specifically, we consider the distinction between dissipative and conservative particles, inert and active particles and, finally, ordinary and strange particles. Strange particles can be described as inferring their own actions, endowing them with apparent autonomy or agency. In short - of the kinds of particles afforded by a particular partition - strange kinds may be apt for describing sentient behaviour.",

      "abstract": "This dissertation reports some first steps towards a compositional account of active inference and the Bayesian brain. Specifically, we use the tools of contemporary applied category theory to supply functorial semantics for approximate inference. To do so, we define on the `syntactic' side the new notion of Bayesian lens and show that Bayesian updating composes according to the compositional lens pattern. Using Bayesian lenses, and inspired by compositional game theory, we define fibrations of statistical games and classify various problems of statistical inference as corresponding sections: the chain rule of the relative entropy is formalized as a strict section, while maximum likelihood estimation and the free energy give lax sections. In the process, we introduce a new notion of `copy-composition'.   On the `semantic' side, we present a new formalization of general open dynamical systems (particularly: deterministic, stochastic, and random; and discrete- and continuous-time) as certain coalgebras of polynomial functors, which we show collect into monoidal opindexed categories (or, alternatively, into algebras for multicategories of generalized polynomial functors). We use these opindexed categories to define monoidal bicategories of cilia: dynamical systems which control lenses, and which supply the target for our functorial semantics. Accordingly, we construct functors which explain the bidirectional compositional structure of predictive coding neural circuits under the free energy principle, thereby giving a formal mathematical underpinning to the bidirectionality observed in the cortex. Along the way, we explain how to compose rate-coded neural circuits using an algebra for a multicategory of linear circuit diagrams, showing subsequently that this is subsumed by lenses and polynomial functors.",

The 'internal universes' of systems are shown to constitute an indexed category of statistical games over polynomials; their dynamics form an indexed category of behaviours. We characterize 'active inference doctrines' as indexed functors between such categories, resolving a number of open problems in our earlier work, and pointing to a formalization of the 'free energy principle' as adjoint to such doctrines.

      "abstract": "Active inference is an account of cognition and behavior in complex systems which brings together action, perception, and learning under the theoretical mantle of Bayesian inference. Active inference has seen growing applications in academic research, especially in fields that seek to model human or animal behavior. While in recent years, some of the code arising from the active inference literature has been written in open source languages like Python and Julia, to-date, the most popular software for simulating active inference agents is the DEM toolbox of SPM, a MATLAB library originally developed for the statistical analysis and modelling of neuroimaging data. Increasing interest in active inference, manifested both in terms of sheer number as well as diversifying applications across scientific disciplines, has thus created a need for generic, widely-available, and user-friendly code for simulating active inference in open-source scientific computing languages like Python. The Python package we present here, pymdp (see https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp), represents a significant step in this direction: namely, we provide the first open-source package for simulating active inference with partially-observable Markov Decision Processes or POMDPs. We review the package's structure and explain its advantages like modular design and customizability, while providing in-text code blocks along the way to demonstrate how it can be used to build and run active inference processes with ease. We developed pymdp to increase the accessibility and exposure of the active inference framework to researchers, engineers, and developers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. In the spirit of open-source software, we also hope that it spurs new innovation, development, and collaboration in the growing active inference community.",

      "abstract": "Under what circumstances can a system be said to have beliefs and goals, and how do such agency-related features relate to its physical state? Recent work has proposed a notion of interpretation map, a function that maps the state of a system to a probability distribution representing its beliefs about an external world. Such a map is not completely arbitrary, as the beliefs it attributes to the system must evolve over time in a manner that is consistent with Bayes' theorem, and consequently the dynamics of a system constrain its possible interpretations. Here we build on this approach, proposing a notion of interpretation not just in terms of beliefs but in terms of goals and actions. To do this we make use of the existing theory of partially observable Markov processes (POMDPs): we say that a system can be interpreted as a solution to a POMDP if it not only admits an interpretation map describing its beliefs about the hidden state of a POMDP but also takes actions that are optimal according to its belief state. An agent is then a system together with an interpretation of this system as a POMDP solution. Although POMDPs are not the only possible formulation of what it means to have a goal, this nevertheless represents a step towards a more general formal definition of what it means for a system to be an agent.",

      "abstract": "This white paper lays out a vision of research and development in the field of artificial intelligence for the next decade (and beyond). Its denouement is a cyber-physical ecosystem of natural and synthetic sense-making, in which humans are integral participants -- what we call ''shared intelligence''. This vision is premised on active inference, a formulation of adaptive behavior that can be read as a physics of intelligence, and which inherits from the physics of self-organization. In this context, we understand intelligence as the capacity to accumulate evidence for a generative model of one's sensed world -- also known as self-evidencing. Formally, this corresponds to maximizing (Bayesian) model evidence, via belief updating over several scales: i.e., inference, learning, and model selection. Operationally, this self-evidencing can be realized via (variational) message passing or belief propagation on a factor graph. Crucially, active inference foregrounds an existential imperative of intelligent systems; namely, curiosity or the resolution of uncertainty. This same imperative underwrites belief sharing in ensembles of agents, in which certain aspects (i.e., factors) of each agent's generative world model provide a common ground or frame of reference. Active inference plays a foundational role in this ecology of belief sharing -- leading to a formal account of collective intelligence that rests on shared narratives and goals. We also consider the kinds of communication protocols that must be developed to enable such an ecosystem of intelligences and motivate the development of a shared hyper-spatial modeling language and transaction protocol, as a first -- and key -- step towards such an ecology.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous robots need to learn the categories of various places by exploring their environments and interacting with users. However, preparing training datasets with linguistic instructions from users is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, effective exploration is essential for appropriate concept formation and rapid environmental coverage. To address this issue, we propose an active inference method, referred to as spatial concept formation with information gain-based active exploration (SpCoAE) that combines sequential Bayesian inference using particle filters and information gain-based destination determination in a probabilistic generative model. This study interprets the robot's action as a selection of destinations to ask the user, `What kind of place is this?' in the context of active inference. This study provides insights into the technical aspects of the proposed method, including active perception and exploration by the robot, and how the method can enable mobile robots to learn spatial concepts through active exploration. Our experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of the SpCoAE in efficiently determining a destination for learning appropriate spatial concepts in home environments.",

      "abstract": "Flexible, goal-directed behavior is a fundamental aspect of human life. Based on the free energy minimization principle, the theory of active inference formalizes the generation of such behavior from a computational neuroscience perspective. Based on the theory, we introduce an output-probabilistic, temporally predictive, modular artificial neural network architecture, which processes sensorimotor information, infers behavior-relevant aspects of its world, and invokes highly flexible, goal-directed behavior. We show that our architecture, which is trained end-to-end to minimize an approximation of free energy, develops latent states that can be interpreted as affordance maps. That is, the emerging latent states signal which actions lead to which effects dependent on the local context. In combination with active inference, we show that flexible, goal-directed behavior can be invoked, incorporating the emerging affordance maps. As a result, our simulated agent flexibly steers through continuous spaces, avoids collisions with obstacles, and prefers pathways that lead to the goal with high certainty. Additionally, we show that the learned agent is highly suitable for zero-shot generalization across environments: After training the agent in a handful of fixed environments with obstacles and other terrains affecting its behavior, it performs similarly well in procedurally generated environments containing different amounts of obstacles and terrains of various sizes at different locations.",

We show that a wide range of geometric theories emerge naturally in these fields, ranging from measure-preserving processes, information divergences, Poisson geometry, and geometric integration. Specifically, we explain how (i) leveraging the symplectic geometry of Hamiltonian systems enable us to construct (accelerated) sampling and optimisation methods, (ii) the theory of Hilbertian subspaces and Stein operators provides a general methodology to obtain robust estimators, (iii) preserving the information geometry of decision-making yields adaptive agents that perform active inference. Throughout, we emphasise the rich connections between these fields; e.g., inference draws on sampling and optimisation, and adaptive decision-making assesses decisions by inferring their counterfactual consequences.

      "abstract": "We advance a novel computational model of multi-agent, cooperative joint actions that is grounded in the cognitive framework of active inference. The model assumes that to solve a joint task, such as pressing together a red or blue button, two (or more) agents engage in a process of interactive inference. Each agent maintains probabilistic beliefs about the goal of the joint task (e.g., should we press the red or blue button?) and updates them by observing the other agent's movements, while in turn selecting movements that make his own intentions legible and easy to infer by the other agent (i.e., sensorimotor communication). Over time, the interactive inference aligns both the beliefs and the behavioral strategies of the agents, hence ensuring the success of the joint action. We exemplify the functioning of the model in two simulations. The first simulation illustrates a ''leaderless'' joint action. It shows that when two agents lack a strong preference about their joint task goal, they jointly infer it by observing each other's movements. In turn, this helps the interactive alignment of their beliefs and behavioral strategies. The second simulation illustrates a \"leader-follower\" joint action. It shows that when one agent (\"leader\") knows the true joint goal, it uses sensorimotor communication to help the other agent (\"follower\") infer it, even if doing this requires selecting a more costly individual plan. These simulations illustrate that interactive inference supports successful multi-agent joint actions and reproduces key cognitive and behavioral dynamics of \"leaderless\" and \"leader-follower\" joint actions observed in human-human experiments. In sum, interactive inference provides a cognitively inspired, formal framework to realize cooperative joint actions and consensus in multi-agent systems.",

Supervised neural networks are constructed with the objective to maximize their performance metric in any given task. This is done by reducing free energy and its associated surprisal during training. However, the bottom-up inference nature of supervised networks is a passive process that renders them fallible to noise. In this paper, we provide a thorough background of supervised neural networks, both generative and discriminative, and discuss their functionality from the perspective of free energy principle. We then provide a framework for introducing action during inference. We introduce a new measurement called stochastic surprisal that is a function of the network, the input, and any possible action. This action can be any one of the outputs that the neural network has learnt, thereby lending stochasticity to the measurement. Stochastic surprisal is validated on two applications: Image Quality Assessment and Recognition under noisy conditions. We show that, while noise characteristics are ignored to make robust recognition, they are analyzed to estimate image quality scores. We apply stochastic surprisal on two applications, three datasets, and as a plug-in on twelve networks. In all, it provides a statistically significant increase among all measures. We conclude by discussing the implications of the proposed stochastic surprisal in other areas of cognitive psychology including expectancy-mismatch and abductive reasoning.",

We then discuss how active inference can be leveraged to design explainable AI systems, namely, by allowing us to model core features of ``introspective'' processes and by generating useful, human-interpretable models of the processes involved in decision-making. We propose an architecture for explainable AI systems using active inference. This architecture foregrounds the role of an explicit hierarchical generative model, the operation of which enables the AI system to track and explain the factors that contribute to its own decisions, and whose structure is designed to be interpretable and auditable by human users. We outline how this architecture can integrate diverse sources of information to make informed decisions in an auditable manner, mimicking or reproducing aspects of human-like consciousness and introspection. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for future research in AI, and the potential ethical considerations of developing AI systems with (the appearance of) introspective capabilities.",

Such neuronal networks spontaneously learn structured behaviours in the absence of reward or reinforcement. In this paper, we characterise this kind of self-organisation through the lens of the free energy principle, i.e., as self-evidencing. We do this by first discussing the definitions of reactive and sentient behaviour in the setting of active inference, which describes the behaviour of agents that model the consequences of their actions. We then introduce a formal account of intentional behaviour, that describes agents as driven by a preferred endpoint or goal in latent state-spaces. We then investigate these forms of (reactive, sentient, and intentional) behaviour using simulations. First, we simulate the aforementioned in vitro experiments, in which neuronal cultures spontaneously learn to play Pong, by implementing nested, free energy minimising processes. The simulations are then used to deconstruct the ensuing predictive behaviour, leading to the distinction between merely reactive, sentient, and intentional behaviour, with the latter formalised in terms of inductive planning. This distinction is further studied using simple machine learning benchmarks (navigation in a grid world and the Tower of Hanoi problem), that show how quickly and efficiently adaptive behaviour emerges under an inductive form of active inference.",

      "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a theoretical framework for describing how (intelligent) systems self-organise into coherent, stable structures by minimising a free energy functional. Active Inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that specifically details how systems that are able to plan for the future (agents) function by minimising particular free energy functionals that incorporate information seeking components. This paper is the first in a series of two where we derive a synthetic version of AIF on free form factor graphs. The present paper focuses on deriving a local version of the free energy functionals used for AIF. This enables us to construct a version of AIF which applies to arbitrary graphical models and interfaces with prior work on message passing algorithms. The resulting messages are derived in our companion paper. We also identify a gap in the graphical notation used for factor graphs. While factor graphs are great at expressing a generative model, they have so far been unable to specify the full optimisation problem including constraints. To solve this problem we develop Constrained Forney-style Factor Graph (CFFG) notation which permits a fully graphical description of variational inference objectives. We then proceed to show how CFFG's can be used to reconstruct prior algorithms for AIF as well as derive new ones. The latter is demonstrated by deriving an algorithm that permits direct policy inference for AIF agents, circumventing a long standing scaling issue that has so far hindered the application of AIF in industrial settings. We demonstrate our algorithm on the classic T-maze task and show that it reproduces the information seeking behaviour that is a hallmark feature of AIF.",

      "abstract": "Entropy maximization and free energy minimization are general physical principles for modeling the dynamics of various physical systems. Notable examples include modeling decision-making within the brain using the free-energy principle, optimizing the accuracy-complexity trade-off when accessing hidden variables with the information bottleneck principle (Tishby et al., 2000), and navigation in random environments using information maximization (Vergassola et al., 2007). Built on this principle, we propose a new class of bandit algorithms that maximize an approximation to the information of a key variable within the system. To this end, we develop an approximated analytical physics-based representation of an entropy to forecast the information gain of each action and greedily choose the one with the largest information gain. This method yields strong performances in classical bandit settings. Motivated by its empirical success, we prove its asymptotic optimality for the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards. Owing to its ability to encompass the system's properties in a global physical functional, this approach can be efficiently adapted to more complex bandit settings, calling for further investigation of information maximization approaches for multi-armed bandit problems.",

      "abstract": "Creating autonomous robots that can actively explore the environment, acquire knowledge and learn skills continuously is the ultimate achievement envisioned in cognitive and developmental robotics. Their learning processes should be based on interactions with their physical and social world in the manner of human learning and cognitive development. Based on this context, in this paper, we focus on the two concepts of world models and predictive coding. Recently, world models have attracted renewed attention as a topic of considerable interest in artificial intelligence. Cognitive systems learn world models to better predict future sensory observations and optimize their policies, i.e., controllers. Alternatively, in neuroscience, predictive coding proposes that the brain continuously predicts its inputs and adapts to model its own dynamics and control behavior in its environment. Both ideas may be considered as underpinning the cognitive development of robots and humans capable of continual or lifelong learning. Although many studies have been conducted on predictive coding in cognitive robotics and neurorobotics, the relationship between world model-based approaches in AI and predictive coding in robotics has rarely been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we clarify the definitions, relationships, and status of current research on these topics, as well as missing pieces of world models and predictive coding in conjunction with crucially related concepts such as the free-energy principle and active inference in the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. Furthermore, we outline the frontiers and challenges involved in world models and predictive coding toward the further integration of AI and robotics, as well as the creation of robots with real cognitive and developmental capabilities in the future.",

Although significant progress has been made in each of these areas independently, the best way to integrate them is an open research question.

Specifically, we examine the clone-structured cognitive graph (CSCG) model of cognitive map formation and compare a naive clone graph agent with an active inference-driven clone graph agent, in three spatial navigation scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that while both agents are effective in simple scenarios, the active inference agent is more effective when planning in challenging scenarios, in which sensory observations provide ambiguous information about location.",

While the use of tools by artificial agents presents a challenging task and has been widely identified as a key goal in the field of autonomous robotics, far less research has tackled the invention of new tools by agents. In this paper, (1) we articulate the distinction between tool discovery and tool innovation by providing a minimal description of the two concepts under the formalism of active inference. We then (2) apply this description to construct a toy model of tool innovation by introducing the notion of tool affordances into the hidden states of the agent's probabilistic generative model. This particular state factorisation facilitates the ability to not just discover tools but invent them through the offline induction of an appropriate tool property.

      "abstract": "Active inference is a theory of perception, learning and decision making, which can be applied to neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning. Recently, reasearch has been taking place to scale up this framework using Monte-Carlo tree search and deep learning. The goal of this activity is to solve more complicated tasks using deep active inference. First, we review the existing literature, then, we progresively build a deep active inference agent. For two agents, we have experimented with five definitions of the expected free energy and three different action selection strategies. According to our experiments, the models able to solve the dSprites environment are the ones that maximise rewards. Finally, we compare the similarity of the representation learned by the layers of various agents using centered kernel alignment. Importantly, the agent maximising reward and the agent minimising expected free energy learn very similar representations except for the last layer of the critic network (reflecting the difference in learning objective), and the variance layers of the transition and encoder networks. We found that the reward maximising agent is a lot more certain than the agent minimising expected free energy. This is because the agent minimising expected free energy always picks the action down, and does not gather enough data for the other actions. In contrast, the agent maximising reward, keeps on selecting the actions left and right, enabling it to successfully solve the task. The only difference between those two agents is the epistemic value, which aims to make the outputs of the transition and encoder networks as close as possible. Thus, the agent minimising expected free energy picks a single action (down), and becomes an expert at predicting the future when selecting this action. This makes the KL divergence between the output of the transition and encoder networks small.",

We consider a model's structure specification consistent with active inference, a theory of human perception and behavior from cognitive science. According to active inference, the agent acts upon the world so as to minimize surprise defined as a measure of the extent to which an agent's current sensory observations differ from its preferred sensory observations. We propose a bi-level optimization approach to estimation which relies on a structural assumption on prior distributions that parameterize the statistical accuracy of the human agent's model of the environment. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we present the estimation of a model for car-following behavior based upon a naturalistic dataset.

As a result, there is an increasing need to intelligently improve the channel capacity of future wireless networks. Motivated by active inference from cognitive neuroscience, this paper investigates joint subchannel and power allocation for an uplink UAV-assisted cognitive NOMA network. Maximizing the sum rate is often a highly challenging optimization problem due to dynamic network conditions and power constraints. To address this challenge, we propose an active inference-based algorithm. We transform the sum rate maximization problem into abnormality minimization by utilizing a generalized state-space model to characterize the time-changing network environment. The problem is then solved using an Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN). The proposed framework consists of an offline perception stage, in which a UAV employs a hierarchical GDBN structure to learn an optimal generative model of discrete subchannels and continuous power allocation. In the online active inference stage, the UAV dynamically selects discrete subchannels and continuous power to maximize the sum rate of secondary users. By leveraging the errors in each episode, the UAV can adapt its resource allocation policies and belief updating to improve its performance over time. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in terms of cumulative sum rate compared to benchmark schemes.",

A generative model capturing the environment dynamics is learned by a network composed of two distinct Hebbian ensembles: a posterior network, which infers latent states given the observations, and a state transition network, which predicts the next expected latent state given current state-action pairs. Experimental studies are conducted using the Mountain Car environment from the OpenAI gym suite, to study the effect of the various Hebbian network parameters on the task performance. It is shown that the proposed Hebbian AIF approach outperforms the use of Q-learning, while not requiring any replay buffer, as in typical reinforcement learning systems. These results motivate further investigations of Hebbian learning for the design of AIF networks that can learn environment dynamics without the need for revisiting past buffered experiences.",

      "abstract": "Robotic manipulation holds the potential to replace humans in the execution of tedious or dangerous tasks. However, control-based approaches are not suitable due to the difficulty of formally describing open-world manipulation in reality, and the inefficiency of existing learning methods. Thus, applying manipulation in a wide range of scenarios presents significant challenges. In this study, we propose a novel method for skill learning in robotic manipulation called Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning (Tactile-AIRL), aimed at achieving efficient training. To enhance the performance of reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce active inference, which integrates model-based techniques and intrinsic curiosity into the RL process. This integration improves the algorithm's training efficiency and adaptability to sparse rewards. Additionally, we utilize a vision-based tactile sensor to provide detailed perception for manipulation tasks. Finally, we employ a model-based approach to imagine and plan appropriate actions through free energy minimization. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly high training efficiency in non-prehensile objects pushing tasks. It enables agents to excel in both dense and sparse reward tasks with just a few interaction episodes, surpassing the SAC baseline. Furthermore, we conduct physical experiments on a gripper screwing task using our method, which showcases the algorithm's rapid learning capability and its potential for practical applications.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise for efficiently learning force control policies in peg-in-hole tasks. However, robots often face difficulties due to visual occlusions by the gripper and uncertainties in the initial grasping pose of the peg. These challenges often restrict force-controlled insertion policies to situations where the peg is rigidly fixed to the end-effector. While vision-based tactile sensors offer rich tactile feedback that could potentially address these issues, utilizing them to learn effective tactile policies is both computationally intensive and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a robust tactile insertion policy that can align the tilted peg with the hole using active inference, without the need for extensive training on large datasets. Our approach employs a dual-policy architecture: one policy focuses on insertion, integrating force control and RL to guide the object into the hole, while the other policy performs active inference based on tactile feedback to align the tilted peg with the hole. In real-world experiments, our dual-policy architecture achieved 90% success rate into a hole with a clearance of less than 0.1 mm, significantly outperforming previous methods that lack tactile sensory feedback (5%). To assess the generalizability of our alignment policy, we conducted experiments with five different pegs, demonstrating its effective adaptation to multiple objects.",

The model characterizes linguistic processing as inference over a hierarchical generative model, facilitating predictions and inferences at various levels of granularity, from syllables to sentences. Our approach combines the strengths of large language models for realistic textual predictions and active inference for guiding eye movements to informative textual information, enabling the testing of predictions. The model exhibits proficiency in reading both known and unknown words and sentences, adhering to the distinction between lexical and nonlexical routes in dual route theories of reading. Our model therefore provides a novel approach to understand the cognitive processes underlying reading and eye movements, within a predictive processing framework. Furthermore, our model can potentially aid in understanding how maladaptive predictive processing can produce reading deficits associated with dyslexia. As a proof of concept, we show that attenuating the contribution of priors during the reading process leads to incorrect inferences and a more fragmented reading style, characterized by a greater number of shorter saccades, aligning with empirical findings regarding eye movements in dyslexic individuals. In summary, our model represents a significant advancement in comprehending the cognitive processes involved in reading and eye movements, with potential implications for understanding dyslexia in terms of maladaptive inference.",

As more and more data is created by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data processing and ML training are carried out by edge devices in close proximity. To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) throughout these operations, systems are supervised and dynamically adapted with the help of ML. However, as long as ML models are not retrained, they fail to capture gradual shifts in the variable distribution, leading to an inaccurate view of the system state. Moreover, as the prediction accuracy decreases, the reporting device should actively resolve uncertainties to improve the model's precision. Such a level of self-determination could be provided by Active Inference (ACI) -- a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We encompassed these concepts in a single action-perception cycle, which we implemented for distributed agents in a smart manufacturing use case. As a result, we showed how our ACI agent was able to quickly and traceably solve an optimization problem while fulfilling QoS requirements.",

We show that the critical time points governing the phase transition are linearly related to each other as a function of learning rate and the reward function.

      "abstract": "Understanding adaptive human driving behavior, in particular how drivers manage uncertainty, is of key importance for developing simulated human driver models that can be used in the evaluation and development of autonomous vehicles. However, existing traffic psychology models of adaptive driving behavior either lack computational rigor or only address specific scenarios and/or behavioral phenomena. While models developed in the fields of machine learning and robotics can effectively learn adaptive driving behavior from data, due to their black box nature, they offer little or no explanation of the mechanisms underlying the adaptive behavior. Thus, a generalizable, interpretable, computational model of adaptive human driving behavior is still lacking. This paper proposes such a model based on active inference, a behavioral modeling framework originating in computational neuroscience. The model offers a principled solution to how humans trade progress against caution through policy selection based on the single mandate to minimize expected free energy. This casts goal-seeking and information-seeking (uncertainty-resolving) behavior under a single objective function, allowing the model to seamlessly resolve uncertainty as a means to obtain its goals. We apply the model in two apparently disparate driving scenarios that require managing uncertainty, (1) driving past an occluding object and (2) visual time sharing between driving and a secondary task, and show how human-like adaptive driving behavior emerges from the single principle of expected free energy minimization.",

      "abstract": "Commonly used objective functions (losses) for a supervised optimization of discriminative neural network classifiers were either distribution-based or metric-based. The distribution-based losses could compromise the generalization or cause classification biases towards the dominant classes of an imbalanced class-sample distribution. The metric-based losses could make the network model independent of any distribution and thus improve its generalization. However, they could still be biased towards the dominant classes and could suffer from discrepancies when a class was absent in both the reference (ground truth) and the predicted labels. In this paper, we proposed a novel optimization process which not only tackled the unbalancedness of the class-sample distribution of the training samples but also provided a mechanism to tackle errors in the reference labels of the training samples. This was achieved by proposing a novel algorithm to find candidate classification labels of the training samples from their prior probabilities and the currently estimated posteriors on the network and a novel objective function for the optimizations. The algorithm was the result of casting the generalized Kelly criterion for optimal betting into a multiclass classification problem. The proposed objective function was the expected free energy of a prospective active inference and could incorporate the candidate labels, the original reference labels, and the priors of the training samples while still being distribution-based. The incorporation of the priors into the optimization not only helped to tackle errors in the reference labels but also allowed to reduce classification biases towards the dominant classes by focusing the attention of the neural network on important but minority foreground classes.",

Previous studies revealed that cognitive maps for physical space navigation involve hippocampal (HC) allocentric codes, while cognitive maps for abstract task space engage medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) task-specific codes. Solving challenging cognitive tasks requires integrating these two types of maps. This is exemplified by spatial alternation tasks in multi-corridor settings, where animals like rodents are rewarded upon executing an alternation pattern in maze corridors. Existing studies demonstrated the HC - mPFC circuit's engagement in spatial alternation tasks and that its disruption impairs task performance. Yet, a comprehensive theory explaining how this circuit integrates task-related and spatial information is lacking. We advance a novel hierarchical active inference model clarifying how the HC - mPFC circuit enables the resolution of spatial alternation tasks, by merging physical and task-space cognitive maps. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate that the model's dual layers acquire effective cognitive maps for navigation within physical (HC map) and task (mPFC map) spaces, using a biologically-inspired approach: a clone-structured cognitive graph. The model solves spatial alternation tasks through reciprocal interactions between the two layers. Importantly, disrupting inter-layer communication impairs difficult decisions, consistent with empirical findings. The same model showcases the ability to switch between multiple alternation rules. However, inhibiting message transmission between the two layers results in perseverative behavior, consistent with empirical findings. In summary, our model provides a mechanistic account of how the HC - mPFC circuit supports spatial alternation tasks and how its disruption impairs task performance.",

The ensuing analysis suggests that the brain learns generative models to navigate the world adaptively, not (or not solely) to understand it. Different living organisms may possess an array of generative models, spanning from those that support action-perception cycles to those that underwrite planning and imagination; namely, from \"explicit\" models that entail variables for predicting concurrent sensations, like objects, faces, or people - to \"action-oriented models\" that predict action outcomes. It then elucidates how generative models and belief dynamics might link to neural representation and the implications of different types of generative models for understanding an agent's cognitive capabilities in relation to its ecological niche. The paper concludes with open questions regarding the evolution of generative models and the development of advanced cognitive abilities - and the gradual transition from \"pragmatic\" to \"detached\" neural representations.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being explored for their potential in real-time decision-making. Moreover, cognitive non-orthogonal multiple access (Cognitive-NOMA) is envisioned as a remedy to address spectrum scarcity and enable massive connectivity. This paper investigates the design of joint subchannel and power allocation in an uplink UAV-based cognitive NOMA network. We aim to maximize the cumulative sum rate by jointly optimizing the subchannel and power allocation based on the UAV's mobility at each time step. This is often formulated as an optimization problem with random variables. However, conventional optimization algorithms normally introduce significant complexity, and machine learning methods often rely on large but partially representative datasets to build solution models, assuming stationary testing data. Consequently, inference strategies for non stationary events are often overlooked. In this study, we introduce a novel active inference-based learning approach, rooted in cognitive neuroscience, to solve this complex problem. The framework involves creating a training dataset using random or iterative methods to find suboptimal resource allocations. This dataset trains a mobile UAV offline, enabling it to learn a generative model of discrete subchannels and continuous power allocation. The UAV then uses this model for online inference. The method incrementally derives new generative models from training data by identifying dynamic equilibrium conditions between required actions and variables, represented within a unique dynamic Bayesian network. The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations, showing efficient performance compared to suboptimal baseline schemes.",

      "abstract": "We introduce Sophisticated Learning (SL), a planning-to-learn algorithm that embeds active parameter learning inside the Sophisticated Inference (SI) tree-search framework of Active Inference. Unlike SI -- which optimizes beliefs about hidden states -- SL also updates beliefs about model parameters within each simulated branch, enabling counterfactual reasoning about how future observations would improve subsequent planning.   We compared SL with Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning (BARL) agents as well as with its parent algorithm, SI. Using a biologically inspired seasonal foraging task in which resources shift probabilistically over a 10x10 grid, we designed experiments that forced agents to balance probabilistic reward harvesting against information gathering.   In early trials, where rapid learning is vital, SL agents survive, on average, 8.2% longer than SI and 35% longer than Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning. While both SL and SI showed equal convergence performance, SL reached this convergence 40% faster than SI. Additionally, SL showed robust out-performance of other algorithms in altered environment configurations.   Our results show that incorporating active learning into multi-step planning materially improves decision making under radical uncertainty, and reinforces the broader utility of Active Inference for modeling biologically relevant behavior.",

      "abstract": "Lowering radiation dose per view and utilizing sparse views per scan are two common CT scan modes, albeit often leading to distorted images characterized by noise and streak artifacts. Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) strives to evaluate perceptual quality in alignment with what radiologists perceive, which plays an important role in advancing low-dose CT reconstruction techniques. An intriguing direction involves developing BIQA methods that mimic the operational characteristic of the human visual system (HVS). The internal generative mechanism (IGM) theory reveals that the HVS actively deduces primary content to enhance comprehension. In this study, we introduce an innovative BIQA metric that emulates the active inference process of IGM. Initially, an active inference module, implemented as a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), is constructed to anticipate the primary content. Then, the dissimilarity map is derived by assessing the interrelation between the distorted image and its primary content. Subsequently, the distorted image and dissimilarity map are combined into a multi-channel image, which is inputted into a transformer-based image quality evaluator. Remarkably, by exclusively utilizing this transformer-based quality evaluator, we won the second place in the MICCAI 2023 low-dose computed tomography perceptual image quality assessment grand challenge. Leveraging the DDPM-derived primary content, our approach further improves the performance on the challenge dataset.",

      "abstract": "Although the latent spaces learned by distinct neural networks are not generally directly comparable, recent work in machine learning has shown that it is possible to use the similarities and differences among latent space vectors to derive \"relative representations\" with comparable representational power to their \"absolute\" counterparts, and which are nearly identical across models trained on similar data distributions. Apart from their intrinsic interest in revealing the underlying structure of learned latent spaces, relative representations are useful to compare representations across networks as a generic proxy for convergence, and for zero-shot model stitching.   In this work we examine an extension of relative representations to discrete state-space models, using Clone-Structured Cognitive Graphs (CSCGs) for 2D spatial localization and navigation as a test case. Our work shows that the probability vectors computed during message passing can be used to define relative representations on CSCGs, enabling effective communication across agents trained using different random initializations and training sequences, and on only partially similar spaces. We introduce a technique for zero-shot model stitching that can be applied post hoc, without the need for using relative representations during training. This exploratory work is intended as a proof-of-concept for the application of relative representations to the study of cognitive maps in neuroscience and AI.",

      "abstract": "Actively inferring user preferences, for example by asking good questions, is important for any human-facing decision-making system. Active inference allows such systems to adapt and personalize themselves to nuanced individual preferences. To enable this ability for instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), one may prompt them to ask users questions to infer their preferences, transforming the language models into more robust, interactive systems. However, out of the box, these models are not efficient at extracting preferences: the questions they generate are not informative, requiring a high number of user interactions and impeding the usability of the downstream system. In this work, we introduce an inference-time algorithm that helps LLMs quickly infer preferences by using more informative questions. Our algorithm uses a probabilistic model whose conditional distributions are defined by prompting an LLM, and returns questions that optimize expected entropy and expected model change. Results in a simplified interactive web shopping setting with real product items show that an LLM equipped with our entropy reduction algorithm outperforms baselines with the same underlying LLM on task performance while using fewer user interactions.",

We then modeled the influence of the avatar robot's behavior on the local participants' statements using an active inference framework that included the presence of a remote participant as a latent variable. Based on the simulation results, we designed the gaze behavior of an avatar robot. Finally, we examined the effectiveness of the designed gaze behavior of the avatar robot. The gaze behavior expressed more of the remote participant's attention and interest in local participants, but local participants expressed fewer opinions in the meeting tasks. The results suggest that gaze behavior increased the presence of the remote participant and discouraged the local participant from speaking in the context of the experimental task. We believe that presence has a sufficiently large influence on whether participants want to express an opinion. It is worth investigating the influence of presence and its control methods using Bayesian models.",

Each process is parameterized by a binary random variable indicating whether the process is anomalous. To identify the anomalies, the decision-making agent is allowed to observe a subset of the processes at each time instant. Also, probing each process has an associated cost. Our objective is to design a sequential selection policy that dynamically determines which processes to observe at each time with the goal to minimize the delay in making the decision and the total sensing cost. We cast this problem as a sequential hypothesis testing problem within the framework of Markov decision processes. This formulation utilizes both a Bayesian log-likelihood ratio-based reward and an entropy-based reward. The problem is then solved using two approaches: 1) a deep reinforcement learning-based approach where we design both deep Q-learning and policy gradient actor-critic algorithms; and 2) a deep active inference-based approach. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms and show that our algorithms adapt to any unknown statistical dependence pattern of the processes.",

Among the widely used data resources, mobile phone data is the one passively collected and has the largest coverage in the population. However, mobile operators cannot pinpoint one user within meters, leading to the difficulties in activity inference. To that end, we propose a data analysis framework to identify user's activity via coupling the mobile phone data with location-based social networks (LBSN) data. The two datasets are integrated into a Bayesian inference module, considering people's circadian rhythms in both time and space. Specifically, the framework considers the pattern of arrival time to each type of facility and the spatial distribution of facilities. The former can be observed from the LBSN Data and the latter is provided by the points of interest (POIs) dataset. Taking Shanghai as an example, we reconstruct the activity chains of 1,000,000 active mobile phone users and analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of each activity type. We assess the results with some official surveys and a real-world check-in dataset collected in Shanghai, indicating that the proposed method can capture and analyze human activities effectively. Next, we cluster users' inferred activity chains with a topic model to understand the behavior of different groups of users. This data analysis framework provides an example of reconstructing and understanding the activity of the population at an urban scale with big data fusion.",

      "abstract": "Learning to infer labels in an open world, i.e., in an environment where the target ``labels'' are unknown, is an important characteristic for achieving autonomy. Foundation models, pre-trained on enormous amounts of data, have shown remarkable generalization skills through prompting, particularly in zero-shot inference. However, their performance is restricted to the correctness of the target label's search space, i.e., candidate labels provided in the prompt. This target search space can be unknown or exceptionally large in an open world, severely restricting their performance. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a two-step, neuro-symbolic framework called ALGO - Action Learning with Grounded Object recognition that uses symbolic knowledge stored in large-scale knowledge bases to infer activities in egocentric videos with limited supervision. First, we propose a neuro-symbolic prompting approach that uses object-centric vision-language models as a noisy oracle to ground objects in the video through evidence-based reasoning. Second, driven by prior commonsense knowledge, we discover plausible activities through an energy-based symbolic pattern theory framework and learn to ground knowledge-based action (verb) concepts in the video. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets (EPIC-Kitchens, GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze Plus, and Charades-Ego) demonstrate its performance on open-world activity inference. We also show that ALGO can be extended to zero-shot inference and demonstrate its competitive performance on the Charades-Ego dataset.",

In a set of simulation studies, we examine dyadic imitative interactions of robots using a variational recurrent neural network model. The model is based on the free energy principle such that a pair of interacting robots find themselves in a loop, attempting to predict and infer each other's actions using active inference. We examined how regulating the complexity term to minimize free energy determines the dynamic characteristics of networks and interactions. When one robot trained with tighter regulation and another trained with looser regulation interact, the latter tends to lead the interaction by exerting stronger action intention, while the former tends to follow by adapting to its observations. The study confirms that the dyadic imitative interaction becomes successful by achieving a high synchronization rate when a leader and a follower are determined by developing action intentions with strong belief and weak belief, respectively.",

      "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) postulates that biological agents perceive and interact with their environment in order to minimize a Variational Free Energy (VFE) with respect to a generative model of their environment. The inference of a policy (future control sequence) according to the FEP is known as Active Inference (AIF). The AIF literature describes multiple VFE objectives for policy planning that lead to epistemic (information-seeking) behavior. However, most objectives have limited modeling flexibility. This paper approaches epistemic behavior from a constrained Bethe Free Energy (CBFE) perspective. Crucially, variational optimization of the CBFE can be expressed in terms of message passing on free-form generative models. The key intuition behind the CBFE is that we impose a point-mass constraint on predicted outcomes, which explicitly encodes the assumption that the agent will make observations in the future. We interpret the CBFE objective in terms of its constituent behavioral drives. We then illustrate resulting behavior of the CBFE by planning and interacting with a simulated T-maze environment. Simulations for the T-maze task illustrate how the CBFE agent exhibits an epistemic drive, and actively plans ahead to account for the impact of predicted outcomes. Compared to an EFE agent, the CBFE agent incurs expected reward in significantly more environmental scenarios. We conclude that CBFE optimization by message passing suggests a general mechanism for epistemic-aware AIF in free-form generative models.",

In the majority of existing schemes, a binary decision of whether a sensor is healthy (functional) or faulty is made based on measured data. The decision boundary is called a threshold and it is usually deterministic. Following a faulty decision, fault recovery is obtained by excluding the malfunctioning sensor. We propose a stochastic fault-tolerant scheme based on active inference and precision learning which does not require a priori threshold definitions to trigger fault recovery. Instead, the sensor precision, which represents its health status, is learned online in a model-free way allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly exclude a failing unit. Experiments on a robotic manipulator show promising results and directions for future work are discussed.",

However, despite its theoretical utility, computational implementations have largely been restricted to low-dimensional, deterministic settings. This paper highlights that this is a consequence of the inability to adequately model stochastic transition dynamics, particularly when an extensive policy (i.e., action trajectory) space must be evaluated during planning. Fortunately, recent advancements propose a modified planning algorithm for finite temporal horizons. We build upon this work to assess the utility of active inference for a stochastic control setting. For this, we simulate the classic windy grid-world task with additional complexities, namely: 1) environment stochasticity; 2) learning of transition dynamics; and 3) partial observability. Our results demonstrate the advantage of using active inference, compared to reinforcement learning, in both deterministic and stochastic settings.",

      "abstract": "A key feature of sequential decision making under uncertainty is a need to balance between exploiting--choosing the best action according to the current knowledge, and exploring--obtaining information about values of other actions. The multi-armed bandit problem, a classical task that captures this trade-off, served as a vehicle in machine learning for developing bandit algorithms that proved to be useful in numerous industrial applications. The active inference framework, an approach to sequential decision making recently developed in neuroscience for understanding human and animal behaviour, is distinguished by its sophisticated strategy for resolving the exploration-exploitation trade-off. This makes active inference an exciting alternative to already established bandit algorithms. Here we derive an efficient and scalable approximate active inference algorithm and compare it to two state-of-the-art bandit algorithms: Bayesian upper confidence bound and optimistic Thompson sampling. This comparison is done on two types of bandit problems: a stationary and a dynamic switching bandit. Our empirical evaluation shows that the active inference algorithm does not produce efficient long-term behaviour in stationary bandits. However, in the more challenging switching bandit problem active inference performs substantially better than the two state-of-the-art bandit algorithms. The results open exciting venues for further research in theoretical and applied machine learning, as well as lend additional credibility to active inference as a general framework for studying human and animal behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Working together on complex collaborative tasks requires agents to coordinate their actions. Doing this explicitly or completely prior to the actual interaction is not always possible nor sufficient. Agents also need to continuously understand the current actions of others and quickly adapt their own behavior appropriately. Here we investigate how efficient, automatic coordination processes at the level of mental states (intentions, goals), which we call belief resonance, can lead to collaborative situated problem-solving. We present a model of hierarchical active inference for collaborative agents (HAICA). It combines efficient Bayesian Theory of Mind processes with a perception-action system based on predictive processing and active inference. Belief resonance is realized by letting the inferred mental states of one agent influence another agent's predictive beliefs about its own goals and intentions. This way, the inferred mental states influence the agent's own task behavior without explicit collaborative reasoning. We implement and evaluate this model in the Overcooked domain, in which two agents with varying degrees of belief resonance team up to fulfill meal orders. Our results demonstrate that agents based on HAICA achieve a team performance comparable to recent state of the art approaches, while incurring much lower computational costs. We also show that belief resonance is especially beneficial in settings were the agents have asymmetric knowledge about the environment. The results indicate that belief resonance and active inference allow for quick and efficient agent coordination, and thus can serve as a building block for collaborative cognitive agents.",

      "abstract": "Active Inference (ActInf) is an emerging theory that explains perception and action in biological agents, in terms of minimizing a free energy bound on Bayesian surprise. Goal-directed behavior is elicited by introducing prior beliefs on the underlying generative model. In contrast to prior beliefs, which constrain all realizations of a random variable, we propose an alternative approach through chance constraints, which allow for a (typically small) probability of constraint violation, and demonstrate how such constraints can be used as intrinsic drivers for goal-directed behavior in ActInf. We illustrate how chance-constrained ActInf weights all imposed (prior) constraints on the generative model, allowing e.g., for a trade-off between robust control and empirical chance constraint violation. Secondly, we interpret the proposed solution within a message passing framework. Interestingly, the message passing interpretation is not only relevant to the context of ActInf, but also provides a general purpose approach that can account for chance constraints on graphical models. The chance constraint message updates can then be readily combined with other pre-derived message update rules, without the need for custom derivations. The proposed chance-constrained message passing framework thus accelerates the search for workable models in general, and can be used to complement message-passing formulations on generative neural models.",

      "abstract": "To date, formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description of the relationship between local-scale interactions between highly autonomous sub-system components (individuals) and global-scale behavior of the composite system (the collective). In this paper we use the Active Inference Formulation (AIF), a framework for explaining the behavior of any non-equilibrium steady state system at any scale, to posit a minimal agent-based model that simulates the relationship between local individual-level interaction and collective intelligence (operationalized as system-level performance). We explore the effects of providing baseline AIF agents (Model 1) with specific cognitive capabilities: Theory of Mind (Model 2); Goal Alignment (Model 3), and Theory of Mind with Goal Alignment (Model 4). These stepwise transitions in sophistication of cognitive ability are motivated by the types of advancements plausibly required for an AIF agent to persist and flourish in an environment populated by other AIF agents, and have also recently been shown to map naturally to canonical steps in human cognitive ability. Illustrative results show that stepwise cognitive transitions increase system performance by providing complementary mechanisms for alignment between agents' local and global optima. Alignment emerges endogenously from the dynamics of interacting AIF agents themselves, rather than being imposed exogenously by incentives to agents' behaviors (contra existing computational models of collective intelligence) or top-down priors for collective behavior (contra existing multiscale simulations of AIF). These results shed light on the types of generic information-theoretic patterns conducive to collective intelligence in human and other complex adaptive systems.",

The target application of AIDA is to propose on-the-spot the most interesting alternative values for the tuning parameters of a hearing aid (HA) algorithm, whenever a HA client is not satisfied with their HA performance. AIDA interprets searching for the \"most interesting alternative\" as an issue of optimal (acoustic) context-aware Bayesian trial design. In computational terms, AIDA is realized as an active inference-based agent with an Expected Free Energy criterion for trial design. This type of architecture is inspired by neuro-economic models on efficient (Bayesian) trial design in brains and implies that AIDA comprises generative probabilistic models for acoustic signals and user responses. We propose a novel generative model for acoustic signals as a sum of time-varying auto-regressive filters and a user response model based on a Gaussian Process Classifier. The full AIDA agent has been implemented in a factor graph for the generative model and all tasks (parameter learning, acoustic context classification, trial design, etc.) are realized by variational message passing on the factor graph.

This affords conditions under which states internal to the blanket encode information about external states.   Second, we introduce dynamics and represent adaptive systems as Markov blankets at steady-state. This allows us to identify a wide class of systems whose internal states appear to infer external states, consistent with variational inference in Bayesian statistics and theoretical neuroscience.   Finally, we partition the blanket into sensory and active states. It follows that active states can be seen as performing active inference and well-known forms of stochastic control (such as PID control), which are prominent formulations of adaptive behaviour in theoretical biology and engineering.",

However, animals very often move with curiosity and seem to be motivated in a reward-free manner. Here we abandon the idea of reward maximization, and propose that the goal of behavior is maximizing occupancy of future paths of actions and states. According to this maximum occupancy principle, rewards are the means to occupy path space, not the goal per se; goal-directedness simply emerges as rational ways of searching for resources so that movement, understood amply, never ends. We find that action-state path entropy is the only measure consistent with additivity and other intuitive properties of expected future action-state path occupancy. We provide analytical expressions that relate the optimal policy and state-value function, and prove convergence of our value iteration algorithm. Using discrete and continuous state tasks, including a high--dimensional controller, we show that complex behaviors such as `dancing', hide-and-seek and a basic form of altruistic behavior naturally result from the intrinsic motivation to occupy path space. All in all, we present a theory of behavior that generates both variability and goal-directedness in the absence of reward maximization.",

As such, we argue that deploying the map-territory fallacy to criticise the use of the FEP and Bayesian mechanics itself constitutes a fallacy: what we call the {\\it map-territory fallacy fallacy}. In so doing, we emphasise a few key points: the uniqueness of the FEP as a model of particles or agents that model their environments; the restoration of convention to the FEP via its relation to the principle of constrained maximum entropy; the `Jaynes optimality' of the FEP under this relation; and finally, the way that this meta-theoretical approach to the FEP clarifies its utility and scope as a formal modelling tool.

Using aspects of classical dynamical systems theory in statistical mechanics, we show that this inference is equivalent to a gradient ascent on the Shannon entropy functional, recovering an approximate Bayesian inference under a locally ergodic probability measure on the state space.

As an integrated approach to living systems, this study presents a free-energy minimization theory overarching the essential features of both the thermodynamic and neuroscientific free-energy principles. Our results reveal that the perception and action of animals result from active inference entailed by free-energy minimization in the brain, and the brain operates as Schr{ö}dinger's machine conducting the neural mechanics of minimizing sensory uncertainty.

In this study, we apply active inference, which has been actively studied in the field of neuroscience in recent years, as an alternative action selection strategy for CMABs. Unlike conventional action selection strategies, it is possible to rigorously evaluate the uncertainty of each option when calculating the expected free energy (EFE) associated with the decision agent's probabilistic model, as derived from the free-energy principle. We specifically address the case where a categorical observation likelihood function is used, such that EFE values are analytically intractable. We introduce new approximation methods for computing the EFE based on variational and Laplace approximations. Extensive simulation study results demonstrate that, compared to other strategies, active inference generally requires far fewer iterations to identify optimal options and generally achieves superior cumulative regret, for relatively low extra computational cost.",

      "abstract": "Recently machine learning using neural networks (NN) has been developed, and many new methods have been suggested. These methods are optimized for the type of input data and work very effectively, but they cannot be used with any kind of input data universally. On the other hand, the human brain is universal for any kind of problem, and we will be able to construct artificial general intelligence if we can mimic the system of how the human brain works. We consider how the human brain learns things uniformly, and find that the essence of learning is the compression of information. We suggest a toy NN model which mimics the system of the human brain, and we show that the NN can compress the input information without ad hoc treatment, only by setting the loss function properly. The loss function is expressed as the sum of the self-information to remember and the loss of the information along with the compression, and its minimum corresponds to the self-information of the original data. To evaluate the self-information to remember, we provided the concept of memory. The memory expresses the compressed information, and the learning proceeds by referring to previous memories. There are many similarities between this NN and the human brain, and this NN is a realization of the free-energy principle which is considered to be a unified theory of the human brain. This work can be applied to any kind of data analysis and cognitive science.",

      "abstract": "An open question in the study of emergent behaviour in multi-agent Bayesian systems is the relationship, if any, between individual and collective inference. In this paper we explore the correspondence between generative models that exist at two distinct scales, using spin glass models as a sandbox system to investigate this question. We show that the collective dynamics of a specific type of active inference agent is equivalent to sampling from the stationary distribution of a spin glass system. A collective of specifically-designed active inference agents can thus be described as implementing a form of sampling-based inference (namely, from a Boltzmann machine) at the higher level. However, this equivalence is very fragile, breaking upon simple modifications to the generative models of the individual agents or the nature of their interactions. We discuss the implications of this correspondence and its fragility for the study of multiscale systems composed of Bayesian agents.",

An alternative, but less explored, model-free RL algorithm is the successor representation, which expresses the value function in terms of a successor matrix of expected future state occupancies. In this paper, we derive the probabilistic interpretation of the successor representation in terms of Bayesian filtering and thus design a novel active inference agent architecture utilizing successor representations instead of model-based planning. We demonstrate that active inference successor representations have significant advantages over current active inference agents in terms of planning horizon and computational cost.

Recently, it has been demonstrated as a promising approach for constructing goal-driven behavior in robotics. Specifically, the active inference controller (AIC) has been successful on several continuous control and state-estimation tasks. Despite its relative success, some established design choices lead to a number of practical limitations for robot control. These include having a biased estimate of the state, and only an implicit model of control actions. In this paper, we highlight these limitations and propose an extended version of the unbiased active inference controller (u-AIC). The u-AIC maintains all the compelling benefits of the AIC and removes its limitations. Simulation results on a 2-DOF arm and experiments on a real 7-DOF manipulator show the improved performance of the u-AIC with respect to the standard AIC.

      "abstract": "Robotic manipulation stands as a largely unsolved problem despite significant advances in robotics and machine learning in the last decades. One of the central challenges of manipulation is partial observability, as the agent usually does not know all physical properties of the environment and the objects it is manipulating in advance. A recently emerging theory that deals with partial observability in an explicit manner is Active Inference. It does so by driving the agent to act in a way that is not only goal-directed but also informative about the environment. In this work, we apply Active Inference to a hard-to-explore simulated robotic manipulation tasks, in which the agent has to balance a ball into a target zone. Since the reward of this task is sparse, in order to explore this environment, the agent has to learn to balance the ball without any extrinsic feedback, purely driven by its own curiosity. We show that the information-seeking behavior induced by Active Inference allows the agent to explore these challenging, sparse environments systematically. Finally, we conclude that using an information-seeking objective is beneficial in sparse environments and allows the agent to solve tasks in which methods that do not exhibit directed exploration fail.",

      "abstract": "Active inference provides a general framework for behavior and learning in autonomous agents. It states that an agent will attempt to minimize its variational free energy, defined in terms of beliefs over observations, internal states and policies. Traditionally, every aspect of a discrete active inference model must be specified by hand, i.e. by manually defining the hidden state space structure, as well as the required distributions such as likelihood and transition probabilities. Recently, efforts have been made to learn state space representations automatically from observations using deep neural networks. In this paper, we present a novel approach of learning state spaces using quantum physics-inspired tensor networks. The ability of tensor networks to represent the probabilistic nature of quantum states as well as to reduce large state spaces makes tensor networks a natural candidate for active inference. We show how tensor networks can be used as a generative model for sequential data. Furthermore, we show how one can obtain beliefs from such a generative model and how an active inference agent can use these to compute the expected free energy. Finally, we demonstrate our method on the classic T-maze environment.",

For agents to interact with the world intelligently, they must translate sensory inputs into the bound-together features that describe each object. These object-based representations form a natural basis for planning behavior. Active inference (AIF) is an influential unifying account of perception and action, but existing AIF models have not leveraged this important inductive bias. To remedy this, we introduce 'object-based active inference' (OBAI), marrying AIF with recent deep object-based neural networks. OBAI represents distinct objects with separate variational beliefs, and uses selective attention to route inputs to their corresponding object slots. Object representations are endowed with independent action-based dynamics. The dynamics and generative model are learned from experience with a simple environment (active multi-dSprites). We show that OBAI learns to correctly segment the action-perturbed objects from video input, and to manipulate these objects towards arbitrary goals.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework for modelling the brain that explains a wide range of mechanisms such as habit formation, dopaminergic discharge and curiosity. Recently, two versions of branching time active inference (BTAI) based on Monte-Carlo tree search have been developed to handle the exponential (space and time) complexity class that occurs when computing the prior over all possible policies up to the time horizon. However, those two versions of BTAI still suffer from an exponential complexity class w.r.t the number of observed and latent variables being modelled. In the present paper, we resolve this limitation by first allowing the modelling of several observations, each of them having its own likelihood mapping. Similarly, we allow each latent state to have its own transition mapping. The inference algorithm then exploits the factorisation of the likelihood and transition mappings to accelerate the computation of the posterior. Those two optimisations were tested on the dSprites environment in which the metadata of the dSprites dataset was used as input to the model instead of the dSprites images. On this task, $BTAI_{VMP}$ (Champion et al., 2022b,a) was able to solve 96.9\\% of the task in 5.1 seconds, and $BTAI_{BF}$ (Champion et al., 2021a) was able to solve 98.6\\% of the task in 17.5 seconds. Our new approach ($BTAI_{3MF}$) outperformed both of its predecessors by solving the task completly (100\\%) in only 2.559 seconds. Finally, $BTAI_{3MF}$ has been implemented in a flexible and easy to use (python) package, and we developed a graphical user interface to enable the inspection of the model's beliefs, planning process and behaviour.",

We then describe ``externally parameterized'' statistical games, and use them to construct two approximate inference doctrines found in the computational neuroscience literature, which we call the `Laplace' and the `Hebb-Laplace' doctrines: the former produces dynamical systems which optimize the posteriors of Gaussian models; and the latter produces systems which additionally optimize the parameters (or `weights') which determine their predictions.",

Surprisingly, when executing such a ``home run'', the mice do not follow the exact reverse path, in fact, the entry path and home path have very little overlap. Recent work proposed a hierarchical active inference model for navigation, where the low level model makes inferences about hidden states and poses that explain sensory inputs, whereas the high level model makes inferences about moving between locations, effectively building a map of the environment. However, using this ``map'' for planning, only allows the agent to find trajectories that it previously explored, far from the observed mice's behaviour. In this paper, we explore ways of incorporating before-unvisited paths in the planning algorithm, by using the low level generative model to imagine potential, yet undiscovered paths. We demonstrate a proof of concept in a grid-world environment, showing how an agent can accurately predict a new, shorter path in the map leading to its starting point, using a generative model learnt from pixel-based observations.",

In this study, we test the ability for the AIF to capture the role of anticipation in the visual guidance of action in humans through the systematic investigation of a visual-motor task that has been well-explored -- that of intercepting a target moving over a ground plane. Previous research demonstrated that humans performing this task resorted to anticipatory changes in speed intended to compensate for semi-predictable changes in target speed later in the approach. To capture this behavior, our proposed \"neural\" AIF agent uses artificial neural networks to select actions on the basis of a very short term prediction of the information about the task environment that these actions would reveal along with a long-term estimate of the resulting cumulative expected free energy. Systematic variation revealed that anticipatory behavior emerged only when required by limitations on the agent's movement capabilities, and only when the agent was able to estimate accumulated free energy over sufficiently long durations into the future. In addition, we present a novel formulation of the prior function that maps a multi-dimensional world-state to a uni-dimensional distribution of free-energy. Together, these results demonstrate the use of AIF as a plausible model of anticipatory visually guided behavior in humans.",

      "abstract": "The underlying processes that enable self-perception are crucial for understanding multisensory integration, body perception and action, and the development of the self. Previous computational models have overlooked an essential aspect: affective or emotional components cannot be uncoupled from the self-recognition process. Hence, here we propose a computational approach to study self-recognition that incorporates affect using state-of-the-art hierarchical active inference. We evaluated our model in a synthetic experiment inspired by the mirror self-recognition test, a benchmark for evaluating self-recognition in animals and humans alike. Results show that i) negative valence arises when the agent recognizes itself and learns something unexpected about its internal states. Furthermore, ii) the agent in the presence of strong prior expectations of a negative affective state will avoid the mirror altogether in anticipation of an undesired learning process. Both results are in line with current literature on human self-recognition.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a first principles approach for understanding the brain in particular, and sentient agents in general, with the single imperative of minimizing free energy. As such, it provides a computational account for modelling artificial intelligent agents, by defining the agent's generative model and inferring the model parameters, actions and hidden state beliefs. However, the exact specification of the generative model and the hidden state space structure is left to the experimenter, whose design choices influence the resulting behaviour of the agent. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to learn a hidden state space structure purely from data, alleviating the experimenter from this tedious design task, but resulting in an entangled, non-interpreteable state space. In this paper, we hypothesize that such a learnt, entangled state space does not necessarily yield the best model in terms of free energy, and that enforcing different factors in the state space can yield a lower model complexity. In particular, we consider the problem of 3D object representation, and focus on different instances of the ShapeNet dataset. We propose a model that factorizes object shape, pose and category, while still learning a representation for each factor using a deep neural network. We show that models, with best disentanglement properties, perform best when adopted by an active agent in reaching preferred observations.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant attention for developing decision-making agents that aim to maximize rewards, specified by an external supervisor, within fully observable environments. However, many real-world problems involve partial observations, formulated as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Previous studies have tackled RL in POMDPs by either incorporating the memory of past actions and observations or by inferring the true state of the environment from observed data. However, aggregating observed data over time becomes impractical in continuous spaces. Moreover, inference-based RL approaches often require many samples to perform well, as they focus solely on reward maximization and neglect uncertainty in the inferred state. Active inference (AIF) is a framework formulated in POMDPs and directs agents to select actions by minimizing a function called expected free energy (EFE). This supplies reward-maximizing (exploitative) behaviour, as in RL, with information-seeking (exploratory) behaviour. Despite this exploratory behaviour of AIF, its usage is limited to discrete spaces due to the computational challenges associated with EFE. In this paper, we propose a unified principle that establishes a theoretical connection between AIF and RL, enabling seamless integration of these two approaches and overcoming their aforementioned limitations in continuous space POMDP settings. We substantiate our findings with theoretical analysis, providing novel perspectives for utilizing AIF in the design of artificial agents. Experimental results demonstrate the superior learning capabilities of our method in solving continuous space partially observable tasks. Notably, our approach harnesses information-seeking exploration, enabling it to effectively solve reward-free problems and rendering explicit task reward design by an external supervisor optional.",

Features and pose information are extracted from a scene and then dynamically routed through a hierarchy of vector-valued nodes called 'capsules' to create an implicit scene graph, with the ultimate aim of learning vision directly as inverse graphics. Despite these intuitions, however, capsule networks are not formulated as explicit probabilistic generative models; moreover, the routing algorithms typically used are ad-hoc and primarily motivated by algorithmic intuition. In this paper, we derive an alternative capsule routing algorithm utilizing iterative inference under sparsity constraints. We then introduce an explicit probabilistic generative model for capsule networks based on the self-attention operation in transformer networks and show how it is related to a variant of predictive coding networks using Von-Mises-Fisher (VMF) circular Gaussian distributions.",

However, in robot control, moving an arm's end-effector to a target position or along a target trajectory requires accurate forward and inverse models. Here we show that by learning the transition (forward) model from interaction, we can use it to drive the learning of an amortized policy. Hence, we revisit policy optimization in relation to the deep active inference framework and describe a modular neural network architecture that simultaneously learns the system dynamics from prediction errors and the stochastic policy that generates suitable continuous control commands to reach a desired reference position. We evaluated the model by comparing it against the baseline of a linear quadratic regulator, and conclude with additional steps to take toward human-like motor control.",

Our attacks are effective across membership inference, attribute inference, and data extraction. For example, our targeted attacks can poison <0.1% of the training dataset to boost the performance of inference attacks by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. Further, an adversary who controls a significant fraction of the training data (e.g., 50%) can launch untargeted attacks that enable 8x more precise inference on all other users' otherwise-private data points.

First, MCMC is run in parallel on (sub)posteriors defined on data partitions. Then, a server combines local results. While efficient, this framework is very sensitive to the quality of subposterior sampling. Common sampling problems such as missing modes or misrepresentation of low-density regions are amplified -- instead of being corrected -- in the combination phase, leading to catastrophic failures. In this work, we propose a novel combination strategy to mitigate this issue. Our strategy, Parallel Active Inference (PAI), leverages Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate modeling and active learning. After fitting GPs to subposteriors, PAI (i) shares information between GP surrogates to cover missing modes; and (ii) uses active sampling to individually refine subposterior approximations. We validate PAI in challenging benchmarks, including heavy-tailed and multi-modal posteriors and a real-world application to computational neuroscience. Empirical results show that PAI succeeds where previous methods catastrophically fail, with a small communication overhead.",

These models account for the mutual information between the (current) visual information and its estimated causes. However, they fail to consider the circular causality between perception and action. In other words, they do not consider where to sample next, given current beliefs. Here, we reclaim salience as an active inference process that relies on two basic principles: uncertainty minimisation and rhythmic scheduling. For this, we make a distinction between attention and salience. Briefly, we associate attention with precision control, i.e., the confidence with which beliefs can be updated given sampled sensory data, and salience with uncertainty minimisation that underwrites the selection of future sensory data. Using this, we propose a new account of attention based on rhythmic precision-modulation and discuss its potential in robotics, providing numerical experiments that showcase advantages of precision-modulation for state and noise estimation, system identification and action selection for informative path planning.",

Then, another RF model trained by the output data of activity inference is used for abnormal activity monitoring. Particularly, RF is chosen for these tasks because of its balanced trade offs between accuracy, time efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability. Moreover, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is utilised to forecast the disease related activity trend of a patient. Consequently, the accuracy of two RF classifiers designed for activity inference and abnormal activity detection is greater than 99 percent and 94 percent, respectively.

      "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) encapsulates multiple learned tasks in a single model and often lets those tasks learn better jointly. However, when deploying MTL onto those real-world systems that are often resource-constrained or latency-sensitive, two prominent challenges arise: (i) during training, simultaneously optimizing all tasks is often difficult due to gradient conflicts across tasks; (ii) at inference, current MTL regimes have to activate nearly the entire model even to just execute a single task. Yet most real systems demand only one or two tasks at each moment, and switch between tasks as needed: therefore such all tasks activated inference is also highly inefficient and non-scalable. In this paper, we present a model-accelerator co-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL. Our framework, dubbed M$^3$ViT, customizes mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers into a vision transformer (ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during training. Then at inference with any task of interest, the same design allows for activating only the task-corresponding sparse expert pathway, instead of the full model. Our new model design is further enhanced by hardware-level innovations, in particular, a novel computation reordering scheme tailored for memory-constrained MTL that achieves zero-overhead switching between tasks and can scale to any number of experts. When executing single-task inference, M$^{3}$ViT achieves higher accuracies than encoder-focused MTL methods, while significantly reducing 88% inference FLOPs. When implemented on a hardware platform of one Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, our co-design framework reduces the memory requirement by 2.4 times, while achieving energy efficiency up to 9.23 times higher than a comparable FPGA baseline.

We build a Bayesian mechanics (BM) by casting the formulation reported in the earlier publication (Kim 2018) to considering active inference beyond passive perception. The BM is a neural implementation of variational Bayes under the FEP in continuous time. The resulting BM is provided as an effective Hamilton's equation of motion and subject to the control signal arising from the brain's prediction errors at the proprioceptive level. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we adopt a simple agent-based model and present a concrete numerical illustration of the brain performing recognition dynamics by integrating BM in neural phase space.

It specifies neuronal dynamics for state-estimation in terms of a descent on (variational) free energy -- a measure of the fit between an internal (generative) model and sensory observations. The free energy gradient is a prediction error -- plausibly encoded in the average membrane potentials of neuronal populations. Conversely, the expected probability of a state can be expressed in terms of neuronal firing rates. We show that this is consistent with current models of neuronal dynamics and establish face validity by synthesising plausible electrophysiological responses. We then show that these neuronal dynamics approximate natural gradient descent, a well-known optimisation algorithm from information geometry that follows the steepest descent of the objective in information space. We compare the information length of belief updating in both schemes, a measure of the distance traveled in information space that has a direct interpretation in terms of metabolic cost. We show that neural dynamics under active inference are metabolically efficient and suggest that neural representations in biological agents may evolve by approximating steepest descent in information space towards the point of optimal inference.",

Recent results in humans have shown that the RHI not only produces a change in the perceived arm location, but also causes involuntary forces. Here, we describe a deep active inference agent in a virtual environment, which we subjected to the RHI, that is able to account for these results. We show that our model, which deals with visual high-dimensional inputs, produces similar perceptual and force patterns to those found in humans.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a normative principle underwriting perception, action, planning, decision-making and learning in biological or artificial agents. From its inception, its associated process theory has grown to incorporate complex generative models, enabling simulation of a wide range of complex behaviours. Due to successive developments in active inference, it is often difficult to see how its underlying principle relates to process theories and practical implementation. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by providing a complete mathematical synthesis of active inference on discrete state-space models. This technical summary provides an overview of the theory, derives neuronal dynamics from first principles and relates this dynamics to biological processes. Furthermore, this paper provides a fundamental building block needed to understand active inference for mixed generative models; allowing continuous sensations to inform discrete representations. This paper may be used as follows: to guide research towards outstanding challenges, a practical guide on how to implement active inference to simulate experimental behaviour, or a pointer towards various in-silico neurophysiological responses that may be used to make empirical predictions.",

      "abstract": "Active inference introduces a theory describing action-perception loops via the minimisation of variational (and expected) free energy or, under simplifying assumptions, (weighted) prediction error. Recently, active inference has been proposed as part of a new and unifying framework in the cognitive sciences: predictive processing. Predictive processing is often associated with traditional computational theories of the mind, strongly relying on internal representations presented in the form of generative models thought to explain different functions of living and cognitive systems. In this work, we introduce an active inference formulation of the Watt centrifugal governor, a system often portrayed as the canonical \"anti-representational\" metaphor for cognition. We identify a generative model of a steam engine for the governor, and derive a set of equations describing \"perception\" and \"action\" processes as a form of prediction error minimisation. In doing so, we firstly challenge the idea of generative models as explicit internal representations for cognitive systems, suggesting that such models serve only as implicit descriptions for an observer. Secondly, we consider current proposals of predictive processing as a theory of cognition, focusing on some of its potential shortcomings and in particular on the idea that virtually any system admits a description in terms of prediction error minimisation, suggesting that this theory may offer limited explanatory power for cognitive systems. Finally, as a silver lining we emphasise the instrumental role this framework can nonetheless play as a mathematical tool for modelling cognitive architectures interpreted in terms of Bayesian (active) inference.",

Although many existing robotics studies use a forward model framework, there are generalization issues with high degrees of freedom. The current study shows that the predictive coding (PC) and active inference (AIF) frameworks, which employ a generative model, can develop better generalization by learning a prior distribution in a low dimensional latent state space representing probabilistic structures extracted from well habituated sensory-motor trajectories. In our proposed model, learning is carried out by inferring optimal latent variables as well as synaptic weights for maximizing the evidence lower bound, while goal-directed planning is accomplished by inferring latent variables for maximizing the estimated lower bound. Our proposed model was evaluated with both simple and complex robotic tasks in simulation, which demonstrated sufficient generalization in learning with limited training data by setting an intermediate value for a regularization coefficient. Furthermore, comparative simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms a conventional forward model in goal-directed planning, due to the learned prior confining the search of motor plans within the range of habituated trajectories.",

      "abstract": "When agents interact socially with different intentions, conflicts are difficult to avoid. Although how agents can resolve such problems autonomously has not been determined, dynamic characteristics of agency may shed light on underlying mechanisms. The current study focused on the sense of agency (SoA), a specific aspect of agency referring to congruence between the agent's intention in acting and the outcome. Employing predictive coding and active inference as theoretical frameworks of perception and action generation, we hypothesize that regulation of complexity in the evidence lower bound of an agent's model should affect the strength of the agent's SoA and should have a critical impact on social interactions. We built a computational model of imitative interaction between a robot and a human via visuo-proprioceptive sensation with a variational Bayes recurrent neural network, and simulated the model in the form of pseudo-imitative interaction using recorded human body movement data. A key feature of the model is that each modality's complexity can be regulated differently with a hyperparameter assigned to each module. We first searched for an optimal setting that endows the model with appropriate coordination of multimodal sensation. This revealed that the vision module's complexity should be more tightly regulated than that of the proprioception module. Using the optimally trained model, we examined how changing the tightness of complexity regulation after training affects the strength of the SoA during interactions. The results showed that with looser regulation, an agent tends to act more egocentrically, without adapting to the other. In contrast, with tighter regulation, the agent tends to follow the other by adjusting its intention. We conclude that the tightness of complexity regulation crucially affects the strength of the SoA and the dynamics of interactions between agents.",

Interaction theorists consider primary intersubjectivity a non-mentalist, pre-theoretical, non-conceptual sort of processes that ground a certain level of communication and understanding, and provide support to higher-level cognitive skills. We argue this sort of low level cognitive interaction, where control is shared in dyadic encounters, is susceptible of study with neural robots. Hence, in this work we pursue three main objectives. Firstly, from the concept of active inference we study primary intersubjectivity as a second person perspective experience characterized by predictive engagement, where perception, cognition, and action are accounted for an hermeneutic circle in dyadic interaction. Secondly, we propose an open-source methodology named \\textit{neural robotics library} (NRL) for experimental human-robot interaction, and a demonstration program for interacting in real-time with a virtual Cartesian robot (VCBot). Lastly, through a study case, we discuss some ways human-robot (hybrid) intersubjectivity can contribute to human science research, such as to the fields of developmental psychology, educational technology, and cognitive rehabilitation.",

Most explainability techniques do not capture the concept-based reasoning that human beings follow. In this work, we attempt to understand the behavior of trained models that perform image processing tasks in the medical domain by building a graphical representation of the concepts they learn. Extracting such a graphical representation of the model's behavior on an abstract, higher conceptual level would unravel the learnings of these models and would help us to evaluate the steps taken by the model for predictions. We show the application of our proposed implementation on two biomedical problems - brain tumor segmentation and fundus image classification. We provide an alternative graphical representation of the model by formulating a concept level graph as discussed above, which makes the problem of intervention to find active inference trails more tractable. Understanding these trails would provide an understanding of the hierarchy of the decision-making process followed by the model. [As well as overall nature of model].

In particular, for the linear case with quadratic functions and Gaussian noise, stochastic control has shown remarkable results in different fields, including robotics, reinforcement learning and neuroscience, especially thanks to the established duality of estimation and control processes. Following this idea we recently introduced a formulation of PID control, one of the most popular methods from classical control, based on active inference, a theory with roots in variational Bayesian methods, and applications in the biological and neural sciences. In this work, we highlight the advantages of our previous formulation and introduce new and more general ways to tackle some existing problems in current controller design procedures. In particular, we consider 1) a gradient-based tuning rule for the parameters (or gains) of a PID controller, 2) an implementation of multiple degrees of freedom for independent responses to different types of signals (e.g., two-degree-of-freedom PID), and 3) a novel time-domain formalisation of the performance-robustness trade-off in terms of tunable constraints (i.e., priors in a Bayesian model) of a single cost functional, variational free energy.",

We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature. We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of reasoning down to the low-level information processing of perception.",

Is this phenomenon, known as sensory attenuation, enabled innately, or acquired through learning? Here, our simulation study using a multimodal hierarchical recurrent neural network model, based on variational free-energy minimization, shows that a mechanism for sensory attenuation can develop through learning of two distinct types of sensorimotor experience, involving self-produced or externally produced exteroceptions. For each sensorimotor context, a particular free-energy state emerged through interaction between top-down prediction with precision and bottom-up sensory prediction error from each sensory area. The executive area in the network served as an information hub. Consequently, shifts between the two sensorimotor contexts triggered transitions from one free-energy state to another in the network via executive control, which caused shifts between attenuating and amplifying prediction-error-induced responses in the sensory areas. This study situates emergence of sensory attenuation (or self-other distinction) in development of distinct free-energy states in the dynamic hierarchical neural system.",

It is this aspect of active inference that allows for the natural emergence of information-seeking behavior. When removing prior outcomes preferences from expected free energy, active inference reduces to optimal Bayesian design, i.e., information gain maximization. Conversely, active inference reduces to Bayesian decision theory in the absence of ambiguity and relative risk, i.e., expected utility maximization. Using these limiting cases, we illustrate how behaviors differ when agents select actions that optimize expected utility, expected information gain, and expected free energy. Our T-maze simulations show optimizing expected free energy produces goal-directed information-seeking behavior while optimizing expected utility induces purely exploitive behavior and maximizing information gain engenders intrinsically motivated behavior.",

      "abstract": "While game theory has been transformative for decision-making, the assumptions made can be overly restrictive in certain instances. In this work, we investigate some of the underlying assumptions of rationality, such as mutual consistency and best response, and consider ways to relax these assumptions using concepts from level-$k$ reasoning and quantal response equilibrium (QRE) respectively. Specifically, we propose an information-theoretic two-parameter model called the Quantal Hierarchy model, which can relax both mutual consistency and best response while still approximating level-$k$, QRE, or typical Nash equilibrium behaviour in the limiting cases. The model is based on a recursive form of the variational free energy principle, representing higher-order reasoning as (pseudo) sequential decision-making in extensive-form game tree. This representation enables us to treat simultaneous games in a similar manner to sequential games, where reasoning resources deplete throughout the game-tree. Bounds in player processing abilities are captured as information costs, where future branches of reasoning are discounted, implying a hierarchy of players where lower-level players have fewer processing resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Quantal Hierarchy model in several canonical economic games, {both simultaneous and sequential}, using out-of-sample modelling.",

This Law is observed in many naturally occurring datasets. It can be seen as a measure of naturalness of a given distribution and finds its application in areas like anomaly and fraud detection. In this work, we address the following question: Is the distribution of the Neural Network parameters related to the network's generalization capability? To that end, we first define a metric, MLH (Model Enthalpy), that measures the closeness of a set of numbers to Benford's Law and we show empirically that it is a strong predictor of Validation Accuracy. Second, we use MLH as an alternative to Validation Accuracy for Early Stopping, removing the need for a Validation set. We provide experimental evidence that even if the optimal size of the validation set is known before-hand, the peak test accuracy attained is lower than not using a validation set at all. Finally, we investigate the connection of BL to Free Energy Principle and First Law of Thermodynamics, showing that MLH is a component of the internal energy of the learning system and optimization as an analogy to minimizing the total energy to attain equilibrium.",

Recently, its Bayesian interpretation has received a growing amount of attention especially in neuroscience, robotics and machine learning. In neuroscience, in particular, models of perception and control under the banners of predictive coding, optimal feedback control, active inference and more generally the so-called Bayesian brain hypothesis, have all heavily relied on ideas behind the Kalman filter. Active inference, an algorithmic theory based on the free energy principle, specifically builds on approximate Bayesian inference methods proposing a variational account of neural computation and behaviour in terms of gradients of variational free energy. Using this ambitious framework, several works have discussed different possible relations between free energy minimisation and standard Kalman filters. With a few exceptions, however, such relations point at a mere qualitative resemblance or are built on a set of very diverse comparisons based on purported differences between free energy minimisation and Kalman filtering. In this work, we present a straightforward derivation of Kalman filters consistent with active inference via a variational treatment of free energy minimisation in terms of gradient descent. The approach considered here offers a more direct link between models of neural dynamics as gradient descent and standard accounts of perception and decision making based on probabilistic inference, further bridging the gap between hypotheses about neural implementation and computational principles in brain and behavioural sciences.",

      "abstract": "Predictive processing has become an influential framework in cognitive sciences. This framework turns the traditional view of perception upside down, claiming that the main flow of information processing is realized in a top-down hierarchical manner. Furthermore, it aims at unifying perception, cognition, and action as a single inferential process. However, in the related literature, the predictive processing framework and its associated schemes such as predictive coding, active inference, perceptual inference, free-energy principle, tend to be used interchangeably.   In the field of cognitive robotics there is no clear-cut distinction on which schemes have been implemented and under which assumptions. In this paper, working definitions are set with the main aim of analyzing the state of the art in cognitive robotics research working under the predictive processing framework as well as some related non-robotic models.   The analysis suggests that, first, both research in cognitive robotics implementations and non-robotic models needs to be extended to the study of how multiple exteroceptive modalities can be integrated into prediction error minimization schemes. Second, a relevant distinction found here is that cognitive robotics implementations tend to emphasize the learning of a generative model, while in non-robotics models it is almost absent. Third, despite the relevance for active inference, few cognitive robotics implementations examine the issues around control and whether it should result from the substitution of inverse models with proprioceptive predictions.   Finally, limited attention has been placed on precision weighting and the tracking of prediction error dynamics. These mechanisms should help to explore more complex behaviors and tasks in cognitive robotics research under the predictive processing framework.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a unifying theory for perception and action resting upon the idea that the brain maintains an internal model of the world by minimizing free energy. From a behavioral perspective, active inference agents can be seen as self-evidencing beings that act to fulfill their optimistic predictions, namely preferred outcomes or goals. In contrast, reinforcement learning requires human-designed rewards to accomplish any desired outcome. Although active inference could provide a more natural self-supervised objective for control, its applicability has been limited because of the shortcomings in scaling the approach to complex environments. In this work, we propose a contrastive objective for active inference that strongly reduces the computational burden in learning the agent's generative model and planning future actions. Our method performs notably better than likelihood-based active inference in image-based tasks, while also being computationally cheaper and easier to train. We compare to reinforcement learning agents that have access to human-designed reward functions, showing that our approach closely matches their performance. Finally, we also show that contrastive methods perform significantly better in the case of distractors in the environment and that our method is able to generalize goals to variations in the background.

We leverage the theoretical connection between active inference and variational message passing as describe by John Winn and Christopher M. Bishop in 2005. Since, variational message passing is a well-defined methodology for deriving Bayesian belief update equations, this paper opens the door to advanced generative models for active inference.

However, this message passing tree search approach, which we call branching-time active inference (BTAI), has never been tested empirically. In this paper, we present an experimental study of BTAI in the context of a maze solving agent. In this context, we show that both improved prior preferences and deeper search help mitigate the vulnerability to local minima. Then, we compare BTAI to standard active inference (AcI) on a graph navigation task. We show that for small graphs, both BTAI and AcI successfully solve the task. For larger graphs, AcI exhibits an exponential (space) complexity class, making the approach intractable. However, BTAI explores the space of policies more efficiently, successfully scaling to larger graphs. Then, BTAI was compared to the POMCP algorithm on the frozen lake environment. The experiments suggest that BTAI and the POMCP algorithm accumulate a similar amount of reward. Also, we describe when BTAI receives more rewards than the POMCP agent, and when the opposite is true. Finally, we compared BTAI to the approach of Fountas et al (2020) on the dSprites dataset, and we discussed the pros and cons of each approach.",

This unification enhances both approaches. On the one hand, tree searches enable the biologically grounded, first principle method of active inference to be applied to large-scale problems. On the other hand, active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which is often addressed heuristically in tree search methods. Our simulations show that AcT successfully navigates binary trees that are challenging for sampling-based methods, problems that require adaptive exploration, and the large POMDP problem 'RockSample'--in which AcT reproduces state-of-the-art POMDP solutions. Furthermore, we illustrate how AcT can be used to simulate neurophysiological responses (e.g., in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) of humans and other animals that solve large planning problems. These numerical analyses show that Active Tree Search is a principled realisation of neuroscientific and AI planning theories, which offer both biological realism and scalability.",

We propose solving the general Stochastic Shortest-Path Markov Decision Process (SSP MDP) as probabilistic inference. Furthermore, we discuss online and offline methods for planning under uncertainty. In an SSP MDP, the horizon is indefinite and unknown a priori. SSP MDPs generalize finite and infinite horizon MDPs and are widely used in the artificial intelligence community. Additionally, we highlight some of the differences between solving an MDP using dynamic programming approaches widely used in the artificial intelligence community and approaches used in the active inference community.",

      "abstract": "Branching Time Active Inference (Champion et al., 2021b,a) is a framework proposing to look at planning as a form of Bayesian model expansion. Its root can be found in Active Inference (Friston et al., 2016; Da Costa et al., 2020; Champion et al., 2021c), a neuroscientific framework widely used for brain modelling, as well as in Monte Carlo Tree Search (Browne et al., 2012), a method broadly applied in the Reinforcement Learning literature. Up to now, the inference of the latent variables was carried out by taking advantage of the flexibility offered by Variational Message Passing (Winn and Bishop, 2005), an iterative process that can be understood as sending messages along the edges of a factor graph (Forney, 2001). In this paper, we harness the efficiency of an alternative method for inference called Bayesian Filtering (Fox et al., 2003), which does not require the iteration of the update equations until convergence of the Variational Free Energy. Instead, this scheme alternates between two phases: integration of evidence and prediction of future states. Both of those phases can be performed efficiently and this provides a seventy times speed up over the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent agents must pursue their goals in complex environments with partial information and often limited computational capacity. Reinforcement learning methods have achieved great success by creating agents that optimize engineered reward functions, but which often struggle to learn in sparse-reward environments, generally require many environmental interactions to perform well, and are typically computationally very expensive. Active inference is a model-based approach that directs agents to explore uncertain states while adhering to a prior model of their goal behaviour. This paper introduces an active inference agent which minimizes the novel free energy of the expected future. Our model is capable of solving sparse-reward problems with a very high sample efficiency due to its objective function, which encourages directed exploration of uncertain states. Moreover, our model is computationally very light and can operate in a fully online manner while achieving comparable performance to offline RL methods. We showcase the capabilities of our model by solving the mountain car problem, where we demonstrate its superior exploration properties and its robustness to observation noise, which in fact improves performance. We also introduce a novel method for approximating the prior model from the reward function, which simplifies the expression of complex objectives and improves performance over previous active inference approaches.",

To this end, the decision-making agent probes a subset of processes at every time instant and obtains a potentially erroneous estimate of the binary variable which indicates whether or not the corresponding process is anomalous. The agent continues to probe the processes until it obtains a sufficient number of measurements to reliably identify the anomalous processes. In this context, we develop a sequential selection algorithm that decides which processes to be probed at every instant to detect the anomalies with an accuracy exceeding a desired value while minimizing the delay in making the decision and the total number of measurements taken. Our algorithm is based on active inference which is a general framework to make sequential decisions in order to maximize the notion of free energy. We define the free energy using the objectives of the selection policy and implement the active inference framework using a deep neural network approximation. Using numerical experiments, we compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art method based on deep actor-critic reinforcement learning and demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm.",

Habitual behavior, which is obtained from the prior distribution of ${z}$, is acquired by reinforcement learning. Goal-directed behavior is determined from the posterior distribution of ${z}$ by planning, using active inference which optimizes the past, current and future ${z}$ by minimizing the variational free energy for the desired future observation constrained by the observed sensory sequence.

      "abstract": "To interact seamlessly with robots, users must infer the causes of a robot's behavior and be confident about that inference. Hence, trust is a necessary condition for human-robot collaboration (HRC). Despite its crucial role, it is largely unknown how trust emerges, develops, and supports human interactions with nonhuman artefacts. Here, we review the literature on trust, human-robot interaction, human-robot collaboration, and human interaction at large. Early models of trust suggest that trust entails a trade-off between benevolence and competence, while studies of human-to-human interaction emphasize the role of shared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We then introduce a model of trust as an agent's best explanation for reliable sensory exchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the cognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of HRC, trust can be cast in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. In this setting, interactive feedback becomes a necessary component of the trustor's perception-action cycle. The resulting model has important implications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration, as it allows the traditional determinants of human trust to be defined in terms of active inference, information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model suggests that boredom and surprise may be used as markers for under and over-reliance on the system. Finally, we examine the role of shared behavior in the genesis of trust, especially in the context of dyadic collaboration, suggesting important consequences for the acceptability and design of human-robot collaborative systems.",

Moreover, these models most often operate on a single frame, which may yield incorrect classifications in case of ambiguous viewpoints. In this paper, we propose an active inference agent that actively gathers evidence for object classifications, and can learn novel object categories over time. Drawing inspiration from the human brain, we build object-centric generative models composed of two information streams, a what- and a where-stream. The what-stream predicts whether the observed object belongs to a specific category, while the where-stream is responsible for representing the object in its internal 3D reference frame. We show that our agent (i) is able to learn representations for many object categories in an unsupervised way, (ii) achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracies, actively resolving ambiguity when required and (iii) identifies novel object categories. Furthermore, we validate our system in an end-to-end fashion where the agent is able to search for an object at a given pose from a pixel-based rendering. We believe that this is a first step towards building modular, intelligent systems that can be used for a wide range of tasks involving three dimensional objects.",

In this opinion, we propose the Insula Hierarchical Modular Adaptive Interoception Control (IMAC) model to suggest that insula modules (granular, dysgranular and agranular subregions), forming networks with prefrontal (supplementary motor area, dorsolateral and ventromedial cortices) and striatum (posterior, dorsomedial and ventromedial) subregions, are specialized for higher-order interoceptive representations, recruited in a context-dependent manner to support habitual, model-based and exploratory adaptive behavior.

      "abstract": "Knowing the position of the robot in the world is crucial for navigation. Nowadays, Bayesian filters, such as Kalman and particle-based, are standard approaches in mobile robotics. Recently, end-to-end learning has allowed for scaling-up to high-dimensional inputs and improved generalization. However, there are still limitations to providing reliable laser navigation. Here we show a proof-of-concept of the predictive processing-inspired approach to perception applied for localization and navigation using laser sensors, without the need for odometry. We learn the generative model of the laser through self-supervised learning and perform both online state-estimation and navigation through stochastic gradient descent on the variational free-energy bound. We evaluated the algorithm on a mobile robot (TIAGo Base) with a laser sensor (SICK) in Gazebo. Results showed improved state-estimation performance when comparing to a state-of-the-art particle filter in the absence of odometry. Furthermore, conversely to standard Bayesian estimation approaches our method also enables the robot to navigate when providing the desired goal by inferring the actions that minimize the prediction error.",

      "abstract": "Motor control is a fundamental process that underlies all voluntary behavioral responses. Several different theories based on different principles (task dynamics, equilibrium-point theory, passive-motion paradigm, active inference, optimal control) account for specific aspects of how actions are produced, but fail to provide a unified view on this problem. Here we propose a concise theory of motor control based on three principles: optimal feedback control, control with a receding time horizon, and task representation by a series of via-points updated at fixed frequency. By construction, the theory provides a suitable solution to the degrees-of-freedom problem, i.e. trajectory formation in the presence of redundancies and noise. We show through computer simulations that the theory also explains the production of discrete, continuous, rhythmic and temporally-constrained movements, and their parametric and statistical properties (scaling laws, power laws, speed/accuracy tradeoffs). The theory has no free parameters and only limited variations in its implementation details and in the nature of noise are necessary to guarantee its explanatory power.",

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.",

The algorithms that emerge using the latter framework bear some appealing characteristics that qualify the probabilistic approach as a powerful alternative to the more traditional control formulations. The idea of using estimation on stochastic models to solve control problems is not new and the inference approach considered here falls under the rubric of Active Inference (AI) and Control as Inference (CAI). In this work, we look at the specific recursions that arise from various cost functions that, although they may appear similar in scope, bear noticeable differences, at least when applied to typical path planning problems. We start by posing the path planning problem on a probabilistic factor graph, and show how the various algorithms translate into specific message composition rules. We then show how this unified approach, presented both in probability space and in log space, provides a very general framework that includes the Sum-product, the Max-product, Dynamic programming and mixed Reward/Entropy criteria-based algorithms. The framework also expands algorithmic design options for smoother or sharper policy distributions, including generalized Sum/Max-product algorithm, a Smooth Dynamic programming algorithm and modified versions of the Reward/Entropy recursions. We provide a comprehensive table of recursions and a comparison through simulations, first on a synthetic small grid with a single goal with obstacles, and then on a grid extrapolated from a real-world scene with multiple goals and a semantic map.",

Most of the data flowing out to a platform actually do not trigger automation actions, while homeowners currently have no control once devices are bound to the platform. We present PFirewall, a customizable data-flow control system to enhance the privacy of IoT platform users. PFirewall automatically generates data-minimization policies, which only disclose minimum amount of data to fulfill automation. In addition, PFirewall provides interfaces for homeowners to customize individual privacy preferences by defining user-specified policies. To enforce these policies, PFirewall transparently intervenes and mediates the communication between IoT devices and the platform, without modifying the platform, IoT devices, or hub. Evaluation results on four real-world testbeds show that PFirewall reduces IoT data sent to the platform by 97% without impairing home automation, and effectively mitigates user-activity inference/tracking attacks and other privacy risks.",

We present an active inference body perception and action model working for the first time in a humanoid robot. The model relies on the free energy principle proposed for the brain, where both perception and action goal is to minimise the prediction error through gradient descent on the variational free energy bound. The body state (latent variable) is inferred by minimising the difference between the observed (visual and proprioceptive) sensor values and the predicted ones. Simultaneously, the action makes sensory data sampling to better correspond to the prediction made by the inner model. We formalised and implemented the algorithm on the iCub robot and tested in 2D and 3D visual spaces for online adaptation to visual changes, sensory noise and discrepancies between the model and the real robot. We also compared our approach with classical inverse kinematics in a reaching task, analysing the suitability of such a neuroscience-inspired approach for real-world interaction. The algorithm gave the robot adaptive body perception and upper body reaching with head object tracking (toddler-like), and was able to incorporate visual features online (in a closed-loop manner) without increasing the computational complexity. Moreover, our model predicted involuntary actions in the presence of sensorimotor conflicts showing the path for a potential proof of active inference in humans.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a first principle account of how autonomous agents operate in dynamic, non-stationary environments. This problem is also considered in reinforcement learning (RL), but limited work exists on comparing the two approaches on the same discrete-state environments. In this paper, we provide: 1) an accessible overview of the discrete-state formulation of active inference, highlighting natural behaviors in active inference that are generally engineered in RL; 2) an explicit discrete-state comparison between active inference and RL on an OpenAI gym baseline. We begin by providing a condensed overview of the active inference literature, in particular viewing the various natural behaviors of active inference agents through the lens of RL. We show that by operating in a pure belief-based setting, active inference agents can carry out epistemic exploration, and account for uncertainty about their environment in a Bayes-optimal fashion. Furthermore, we show that the reliance on an explicit reward signal in RL is removed in active inference, where reward can simply be treated as another observation; even in the total absence of rewards, agent behaviors are learned through preference learning. We make these properties explicit by showing two scenarios in which active inference agents can infer behaviors in reward-free environments compared to both Q-learning and Bayesian model-based RL agents; by placing zero prior preferences over rewards and by learning the prior preferences over the observations corresponding to reward. We conclude by noting that this formalism can be applied to more complex settings if appropriate generative models can be formulated. In short, we aim to demystify the behavior of active inference agents by presenting an accessible discrete state-space and time formulation, and demonstrate these behaviors in a OpenAI gym environment, alongside RL agents.",

The proposed method is based on active inference, a promising neuroscientific theory of the brain, which describes a biologically plausible algorithm for perception and action. In this work, we formulate active inference from a control perspective, deriving a model-free control law which is less sensitive to unmodeled dynamics. The performance and the adaptive properties of the algorithm are compared to a state-of-the-art model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) in an experimental setup with a real 7-DOF robot arm. The results showed that the AIC outperformed the MRAC in terms of adaptability, providing a more general control law. This confirmed the relevance of active inference for robot control.",

      "abstract": "In psychology and neuroscience it is common to describe cognitive systems as input/output devices where perceptual and motor functions are implemented in a purely feedforward, open-loop fashion. On this view, perception and action are often seen as encapsulated modules with limited interaction between them. While embodied and enactive approaches to cognitive science have challenged the idealisation of the brain as an input/output device, we argue that even the more recent attempts to model systems using closed-loop architectures still heavily rely on a strong separation between motor and perceptual functions. Previously, we have suggested that the mainstream notion of modularity strongly resonates with the separation principle of control theory. In this work we present a minimal model of a sensorimotor loop implementing an architecture based on the separation principle. We link this to popular formulations of perception and action in the cognitive sciences, and show its limitations when, for instance, external forces are not modelled by an agent. These forces can be seen as variables that an agent cannot directly control, i.e., a perturbation from the environment or an interference caused by other agents. As an alternative approach inspired by embodied cognitive science, we then propose a nonmodular architecture based on the active inference framework. We demonstrate the robustness of this architecture to unknown external inputs and show that the mechanism with which this is achieved in linear models is equivalent to integral control.",

      "abstract": "One of the limitations of deep learning models with sparse features today stems from the predefined nature of their input, which requires a dictionary be defined prior to the training. With this paper we propose both a theory and a working system design which remove this limitation, and show that the resulting models are able to perform better and efficiently run at a much larger scale. Specifically, we achieve this by decoupling a model's content from its form to tackle architecture evolution and memory growth separately. To efficiently handle model growth, we propose a new neuron model, called DynamicCell, drawing inspiration from from the free energy principle [15] to introduce the concept of reaction to discharge non-digestive energy, which also subsumes gradient descent based approaches as its special cases. We implement DynamicCell by introducing a new server into TensorFlow to take over most of the work involving model growth. Consequently, it enables any existing deep learning models to efficiently handle arbitrary number of distinct sparse features (e.g., search queries), and grow incessantly without redefining the model. Most notably, one of our models, which has been reliably running in production for over a year, is capable of suggesting high quality keywords for advertisers of Google Smart Campaigns and achieved significant accuracy gains based on a challenging metric -- evidence that data-driven, self-evolving systems can potentially exceed the performance of traditional rule-based approaches.",

In this work, we frame active inference through the lens of control as inference (CaI), a body of work that presents trajectory optimization as inference. From the wider view of `probabilistic numerics', CaI offers principled, numerically robust optimal control solvers that provide uncertainty quantification, and can scale to nonlinear problems with approximate inference. We show that AI may be framed as partially-observed CaI when the cost function is defined specifically in the observation states.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a probabilistic framework for modelling the behaviour of biological and artificial agents, which derives from the principle of minimising free energy. In recent years, this framework has successfully been applied to a variety of situations where the goal was to maximise reward, offering comparable and sometimes superior performance to alternative approaches. In this paper, we clarify the connection between reward maximisation and active inference by demonstrating how and when active inference agents perform actions that are optimal for maximising reward. Precisely, we show the conditions under which active inference produces the optimal solution to the Bellman equation--a formulation that underlies several approaches to model-based reinforcement learning and control. On partially observed Markov decision processes, the standard active inference scheme can produce Bellman optimal actions for planning horizons of 1, but not beyond. In contrast, a recently developed recursive active inference scheme (sophisticated inference) can produce Bellman optimal actions on any finite temporal horizon. We append the analysis with a discussion of the broader relationship between active inference and reinforcement learning.",

At its core, active inference is based on the principle that the brain is an approximate Bayesian inference engine, building an internal generative model to drive agents towards minimal surprise.

In this paper, we leverage recent advances in deep learning to build more complex generative models that can work without a predefined states space.

      "abstract": "Active inference is a Bayesian framework for understanding biological intelligence. The underlying theory brings together perception and action under one single imperative: minimizing free energy. However, despite its theoretical utility in explaining intelligence, computational implementations have been restricted to low-dimensional and idealized situations. In this paper, we present a neural architecture for building deep active inference agents operating in complex, continuous state-spaces using multiple forms of Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. For this, we introduce a number of techniques, novel to active inference. These include: i) selecting free-energy-optimal policies via MC tree search, ii) approximating this optimal policy distribution via a feed-forward `habitual' network, iii) predicting future parameter belief updates using MC dropouts and, finally, iv) optimizing state transition precision (a high-end form of attention). Our approach enables agents to learn environmental dynamics efficiently, while maintaining task performance, in relation to reward-based counterparts. We illustrate this in a new toy environment, based on the dSprites data-set, and demonstrate that active inference agents automatically create disentangled representations that are apt for modeling state transitions. In a more complex Animal-AI environment, our agents (using the same neural architecture) are able to simulate future state transitions and actions (i.e., plan), to evince reward-directed navigation - despite temporary suspension of visual input. These results show that deep active inference - equipped with MC methods - provides a flexible framework to develop biologically-inspired intelligent agents, with applications in both machine learning and cognitive science.",

This framework combines Kalman-Bucy filters for the estimation of hidden states with Linear Quadratic Regulators for the control of their dynamics. Nowadays, LQG is also a common paradigm in neuroscience, where it is used to characterise different approaches to sensorimotor control based on state estimators, forward and inverse models. According to this paradigm, perception can be seen as a process of Bayesian inference and action as a process of optimal control. Recently, active inference has been introduced as a process theory derived from a variational approximation of Bayesian inference problems that describes, among others, perception and action in terms of (variational and expected) free energy minimisation. Active inference relies on a mathematical formalism similar to LQG, but offers a rather different perspective on problems of sensorimotor control in biological systems based on a process of biased perception. In this note we compare the mathematical treatments of these two frameworks for linear systems, focusing on their respective assumptions and highlighting their commonalities and technical differences.",

The proposed approach allows handling partially observable initial states and improves the robustness of classical BTs against unexpected contingencies while at the same time reducing the number of nodes in a tree. In this work, we specify the nominal behavior offline, through BTs. However, in contrast to previous approaches, we introduce a new type of leaf node to specify the desired state to be achieved rather than an action to execute. The decision of which action to execute to reach the desired state is performed online through active inference. This results in continual online planning and hierarchical deliberation. By doing so, an agent can follow a predefined offline plan while still keeping the ability to locally adapt and take autonomous decisions at runtime, respecting safety constraints. We provide proof of convergence and robustness analysis, and we validate our method in two different mobile manipulators performing similar tasks, both in a simulated and real retail environment. The results showed improved runtime adaptability with a fraction of the hand-coded nodes compared to classical BTs.",

However, only a selected group of animals, mainly high order mammals such as humans, has passed the mirror test, a behavioural experiment proposed to assess self-recognition abilities. In this paper, we describe self-recognition as a process that is built on top of body perception unconscious mechanisms. We present an algorithm that enables a robot to perform non-appearance self-recognition on a mirror and distinguish its simple actions from other entities, by answering the following question: am I generating these sensations? The algorithm combines active inference, a theoretical model of perception and action in the brain, with neural network learning. The robot learns the relation between its actions and its body with the effect produced in the visual field and its body sensors. The prediction error generated between the models and the real observations during the interaction is used to infer the body configuration through free energy minimization and to accumulate evidence for recognizing its body. Experimental results on a humanoid robot show the reliability of the algorithm for different initial conditions, such as mirror recognition in any perspective, robot-robot distinction and human-robot differentiation.",

For reinforcement learning tasks, the distribution of preferences replaces the notion of reward. We explore a scenario in which the agent learns this distribution in a self-supervised manner. In particular, we highlight the distinction between observations induced by the environment and those pertaining more directly to the continuity of an agent in time.

In brief, active inference replaces value functions with functionals of (Bayesian) beliefs, in the form of an expected (variational) free energy. In this paper, we consider a sophisticated kind of active inference, using a recursive form of expected free energy. Sophistication describes the degree to which an agent has beliefs about beliefs. We consider agents with beliefs about the counterfactual consequences of action for states of affairs and beliefs about those latent states. In other words, we move from simply considering beliefs about 'what would happen if I did that' to 'what would I believe about what would happen if I did that'. The recursive form of the free energy functional effectively implements a deep tree search over actions and outcomes in the future. Crucially, this search is over sequences of belief states, as opposed to states per se. We illustrate the competence of this scheme, using numerical simulations of deep decision problems.",

When combined with a reward structure, it forms the core of a lightweight variational free energy minimization setup. The main difficulty lies in the maintenance of this simplified effect model together with the online update of the policy. When the prior target distribution is uniform, it provides a ways to learn an efficient exploration policy, consistently with the intrinsic curiosity principles. When combined with an extrinsic reward, our approach is finally shown to provide a faster training than traditional off-policy techniques.",

      "abstract": "Human learning and intelligence work differently from the supervised pattern recognition approach adopted in most deep learning architectures. Humans seem to learn rich representations by exploration and imitation, build causal models of the world, and use both to flexibly solve new tasks. We suggest a simple but effective unsupervised model which develops such characteristics. The agent learns to represent the dynamical physical properties of its environment by intrinsically motivated exploration, and performs inference on this representation to reach goals. For this, a set of self-organizing maps which represent state-action pairs is combined with a causal model for sequence prediction. The proposed system is evaluated in the cartpole environment. After an initial phase of playful exploration, the agent can execute kinematic simulations of the environment's future, and use those for action planning. We demonstrate its performance on a set of several related, but different one-shot imitation tasks, which the agent flexibly solves in an active inference style.",

      "abstract": "In model-based learning, an agent's model is commonly defined over transitions between consecutive states of an environment even though planning often requires reasoning over multi-step timescales, with intermediate states either unnecessary, or worse, accumulating prediction error. In contrast, intelligent behaviour in biological organisms is characterised by the ability to plan over varying temporal scales depending on the context. Inspired by the recent works on human time perception, we devise a novel approach to learning a transition dynamics model, based on the sequences of episodic memories that define the agent's subjective timescale - over which it learns world dynamics and over which future planning is performed. We implement this in the framework of active inference and demonstrate that the resulting subjective-timescale model (STM) can systematically vary the temporal extent of its predictions while preserving the same computational efficiency. Additionally, we show that STM predictions are more likely to introduce future salient events (for example new objects coming into view), incentivising exploration of new areas of the environment. As a result, STM produces more informative action-conditioned roll-outs that assist the agent in making better decisions. We validate significant improvement in our STM agent's performance in the Animal-AI environment against a baseline system, trained using the environment's objective-timescale dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Fighting wildfires is a precarious task, imperiling the lives of engaging firefighters and those who reside in the fire's path. Firefighters need online and dynamic observation of the firefront to anticipate a wildfire's unknown characteristics, such as size, scale, and propagation velocity, and to plan accordingly. In this paper, we propose a distributed control framework to coordinate a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for a human-centered active sensing of wildfires. We develop a dual-criterion objective function based on Kalman uncertainty residual propagation and weighted multi-agent consensus protocol, which enables the UAVs to actively infer the wildfire dynamics and parameters, track and monitor the fire transition, and safely manage human firefighters on the ground using acquired information. We evaluate our approach relative to prior work, showing significant improvements by reducing the environment's cumulative uncertainty residual by more than $ 10^2 $ and $ 10^5 $ times in firefront coverage performance to support human-robot teaming for firefighting. We also demonstrate our method on physical robots in a mock firefighting exercise.",

Renormalization techniques permit us to construct good estimators for the posterior signal mean within information field theory (IFT), but the approximations and assumptions made are not very obvious. Here we introduce the simple concept of minimal Gibbs free energy to IFT, and show that previous renormalization results emerge naturally. They can be understood as being the Gaussian approximation to the full posterior probability, which has maximal cross information with it. We derive optimized estimators for three applications, to illustrate the usage of the framework: (i) reconstruction of a log-normal signal from Poissonian data with background counts and point spread function, as it is needed for gamma ray astronomy and for cosmography using photometric galaxy redshifts, (ii) inference of a Gaussian signal with unknown spectrum and (iii) inference of a Poissonian log-normal signal with unknown spectrum, the combination of (i) and (ii). Finally we explain how Gaussian knowledge states constructed by the minimal Gibbs free energy principle at different temperatures can be combined into a more accurate surrogate of the non-Gaussian posterior.",

In this paper, we consider multivariate counting processes depending on an unknown function parameter to be estimated by linear combinations of a fixed dictionary. To select coefficients, we propose an adaptive $\\ell_1$-penalization methodology, where data-driven weights of the penalty are derived from new Bernstein type inequalities for martingales. Oracle inequalities are established under assumptions on the Gram matrix of the dictionary. Nonasymptotic probabilistic results for multivariate Hawkes processes are proven, which allows us to check these assumptions by considering general dictionaries based on histograms, Fourier or wavelet bases. Motivated by problems of neuronal activity inference, we finally carry out a simulation study for multivariate Hawkes processes and compare our methodology with the adaptive Lasso procedure proposed by Zou in (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101 (2006) 1418-1429). We observe an excellent behavior of our procedure. We rely on theoretical aspects for the essential question of tuning our methodology. Unlike adaptive Lasso of (J. Amer. Statist.

The architecture of the proposed approach consists two main Bayesian models, implementing the touch attention mechanisms of the system.

The model pi_tar actively infers the next region of the workspace that should be explored by the robotic system, integrating the task information, the permanently updated saliency and uncertainty maps extracted from the perceived haptic stimulus map, as well as, inhibition-of-return mechanisms.   The experimental results demonstrate that the Bayesian model pi_per can be used to discriminate 10 different classes of materials with an average recognition rate higher than 90% . The generalization capability of the proposed models was demonstrated experimentally. The ATLAS robot, in the simulation, was able to perform the following of a discontinuity between two regions made of different materials with a divergence smaller than 1cm (30 trials). The tests were performed in scenarios with 3 different configurations of the discontinuity. The Bayesian models have demonstrated the capability to manage the uncertainty about the structure of the surfaces and sensory noise to make correct motor decisions from haptic percepts.",

This paper is aimed to probe the dynamo hysteresis predicted by the recent mean-field models of Kitchatinov \\& Olemskoy (2010) with direct numerical simulations. We perform three-dimensional simulations of large-scale dynamos in a shearing box with helically forced turbulence. As initial condition, we either take a weak random magnetic field or we start from a snapshot of an earlier simulation. Two quasi-stable states are found to coexist in a certain range of parameters close to the onset of the large-scale dynamo. The simulations converge to one of these states depending on the initial conditions. When either the fractional helicity or the magnetic Prandtl number is increased between successive runs above the critical value for onset of the dynamo, the field strength jumps to a finite value. However, when the fractional helicity or the magnetic Prandtl number is then decreased again, the field strength stays at a similar value (strong field branch) even below the original onset. We also observe intermittent decaying phases away from the strong field branch close to the point where large-scale dynamo action is just possible. The dynamo hysteresis seen previously in mean-field models is thus reproduced by 3D simulations. Its possible relation to distinct modes of solar activity such as grand minima is discussed.",

These are combined with optical imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to assess the activity and properties of member galaxies. Prior X-ray studies have suggested A2111 is a head-on cluster merger, a dynamical state which might be connected to the high level of activity inferred from its blue fraction. We are able to directly assess this claim, using our spectroscopic data to identify 95 cluster members among 196 total galaxy spectra. These galaxy velocities do not themselves provide significant evidence for the merger interpretation, however they are consistent with it provided the system is viewed near the time of core passage and at a viewing angle >~30 degrees different from the merger axis. The SDSS data allow us to confirm the high blue fraction for A2111, f_b = 0.15 +/- 0.03 based on photometry alone and f_b = 0.23 +/- 0.03 using spectroscopic data to remove background galaxies. We are able to detect 175 optical sources from the SDSS in our VLA radio data, of which 35 have redshift information. We use the SDSS photometry to determine photometric redshifts for the remaining 140 radio-optical sources. In total we identify up to 26 cluster radio galaxies, 14 of which have spectroscopic redshifts. The optical spectroscopy and radio data reveal a substantial population of dusty starbursts within the cluster. The high blue fraction and prevalence of star formation is consistent with the hypothesis that dynamically-active clusters are associated with more active member galaxies than relaxed clusters.",

In this work we suggest that the modular independence of action and perception strongly resonates with the separation principle of control theory and furthermore that this principle provides formal criteria within which to evaluate the implications of the modularity of action and perception. We will also see that real-time feedback with the environment, often considered necessary for the definition of 4Es ideas, is not however a sufficient condition to avoid the \"classical sandwich\". Finally, we argue that an emerging framework in the cognitive and brain sciences, active inference, extends ideas derived from control theory to the study of biological systems while disposing of the separation principle, describing non-modular models of behaviour strongly aligned with 4Es theories of cognition.",

Ferromagnetism accounts for the prior expectation of data smoothness, i.e. a positive correlation between neighbouring pixels (Ising spins), while the magnetic field refers to the bias. The restoration is actively supervised by requesting the true values of certain pixels after a noisy observation. This additional information improves restoration of other pixels. The optimal strategy of active inference is not known for realistic (two-dimensional) images. We determine this strategy for the mean-field version of the model and show that it amounts to supervising the values of spins (pixels) that do not agree with the sign of the average magnetization. The strategy leads to a transparent analytical expression for the minimal Bayesian risk, and shows that there is a maximal number of pixels beyond of which the supervision is useless. We show numerically that this strategy applies for two-dimensional images away from the critical regime. Within this regime the strategy is outperformed by its local (adaptive) version, which supervises pixels that do not agree with their Bayesian estimate. We show on transparent examples how active supervising can be essential in recovering noise-corrupted images and advocate for a wider usage of active methods in image restoration.",

We design white-box inference attacks to perform a comprehensive privacy analysis of deep learning models. We measure the privacy leakage through parameters of fully trained models as well as the parameter updates of models during training. We design inference algorithms for both centralized and federated learning, with respect to passive and active inference attackers, and assuming different adversary prior knowledge.   We evaluate our novel white-box membership inference attacks against deep learning algorithms to trace their training data records. We show that a straightforward extension of the known black-box attacks to the white-box setting (through analyzing the outputs of activation functions) is ineffective. We therefore design new algorithms tailored to the white-box setting by exploiting the privacy vulnerabilities of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which is the algorithm used to train deep neural networks. We investigate the reasons why deep learning models may leak information about their training data. We then show that even well-generalized models are significantly susceptible to white-box membership inference attacks, by analyzing state-of-the-art pre-trained and publicly available models for the CIFAR dataset. We also show how adversarial participants, in the federated learning setting, can successfully run active membership inference attacks against other participants, even when the global model achieves high prediction accuracies.",

      "abstract": "This monograph attempts a theory of every 'thing' that can be distinguished from other things in a statistical sense. The ensuing statistical independencies, mediated by Markov blankets, speak to a recursive composition of ensembles (of things) at increasingly higher spatiotemporal scales. This decomposition provides a description of small things; e.g., quantum mechanics - via the Schrodinger equation, ensembles of small things - via statistical mechanics and related fluctuation theorems, through to big things - via classical mechanics. These descriptions are complemented with a Bayesian mechanics for autonomous or active things. Although this work provides a formulation of every thing, its main contribution is to examine the implications of Markov blankets for self-organisation to nonequilibrium steady-state. In brief, we recover an information geometry and accompanying free energy principle that allows one to interpret the internal states of something as representing or making inferences about its external states. The ensuing Bayesian mechanics is compatible with quantum, statistical and classical mechanics and may offer a formal description of lifelike particles.",

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-known technique for learning such policies. However, current RL algorithms often have to deal with reward shaping, have difficulties generalizing to other environments and are most often sample inefficient. In this paper, we explore active inference and the free energy principle, a normative theory from neuroscience that explains how self-organizing biological systems operate by maintaining a model of the world and casting action selection as an inference problem. We apply this concept to a typical problem known to the RL community, the mountain car problem, and show how active inference encompasses both RL and learning from demonstrations.",

This article examines hypotheses about organisms' adaptation to the environment from machine learning, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic perspectives. We start with constructing a hierarchical model of the world as an internal model in the brain, and review standard machine learning methods to infer causes by approximately learning the model under the maximum likelihood principle. This in turn provides an overview of the free energy principle for an organism, a hypothesis to explain perception and action from the principle of least surprise. Treating this statistical learning as communication between the world and brain, learning is interpreted as a process to maximize information about the world. We investigate how the classical theories of perception such as the infomax principle relates to learning the hierarchical model. We then present an approach to the recognition and learning based on thermodynamics, showing that adaptation by causal learning results in the second law of thermodynamics whereas inference dynamics that fuses observation with prior knowledge forms a thermodynamic process. These provide a unified view on the adaptation of organisms to the environment.",

Here I will propose that these perspectives are fully compatible, in that analogical reasoning can be described in terms of Bayesian inference and vice versa, and that both of these positions require a thorough cybernetic grounding in order to fulfill their promise as unifying frameworks for understanding minds. From the Bayesian perspective of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, thought is constituted by dynamics of cascading belief propagation through the nodes of probabilistic generative models specified by a cortical heterarchy \"rooted\" in action-perception cycles that ground the mind as an embodied control system for an autonomous agent. From the analogical structure mapping perspective, thought is constituted by the alignment and comparison of heterogeneous structural representations. Here I will propose that this core cognitive process for analogical reasoning is naturally implemented by predictive coding mechanisms. However, both Bayesian cognitive science and models of cognitive development via analogical reasoning require rich base domains and priors (or reliably learnable posteriors) from which they can commence the process of bootstrapping minds. Here in the spirit of the work of George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, I propose that embodiment provides many of the inductive biases that are usually described in terms of innate core knowledge.

In order to further underline the Hochschild cohomological nature af information functions and chain rules, following, the computation of the cohomology in low degrees is detailed to show more directly that the $k$ multivariate mutual-informations (I_k) are k-coboundaries. The k-cocycles condition corresponds to I_k=0, generalizing statistical independence. Hence the cohomology quantifies the statistical dependences and the obstruction to factorization. The topological approach allows to investigate information in the multivariate case without the assumptions of independent identically distributed variables and without mean field approximations. We develop the computationally tractable subcase of simplicial information cohomology represented by entropy H_k and information I_k landscapes and their respective paths. The I_1 component defines a self-internal energy U_k, and I_k,k>1 components define the contribution to a free energy G_k (the total correlation) of the k-body interactions. The set of information paths in simplicial structures is in bijection with the symmetric group and random processes, provides a trivial topological expression of the 2nd law of thermodynamic. The local minima of free-energy, related to conditional information negativity, and conditional independence, characterize a minimum free energy complex. This complex formalizes the minimum free-energy principle in topology, provides a definition of a complex system, and characterizes a multiplicity of local minima that quantifies the diversity observed in biology. I give an interpretation of this complex in terms of frustration in glass and of Van Der Walls k-body interactions for data points.",

Model-based RL suggests that this is best achieved by learning and exploiting a probabilistic model of the world.

On this framework, inference, learning and action emerge from a single imperative to maximize the Bayesian evidence for a niched model of the world. However, implementations of this process have thus far been restricted to low-dimensional and idealized situations. Here, we present a working implementation of active inference that applies to high-dimensional tasks, with proof-of-principle results demonstrating efficient exploration and an order of magnitude increase in sample efficiency over strong model-free baselines.

In this paper we propose a novel deep Active Inference algorithm which approximates key densities using deep neural networks as flexible function approximators, which enables Active Inference to scale to significantly larger and more complex tasks.

We suggest that humans appear to possess an evolved adaptive prior belief that their mental states are aligned with those of conspecifics. Cooperative communication emerges as the principal means to gather evidence for this belief.

The efficiency of state-of-the-art text readability assessment models can be further improved using deep reinforcement learning models.

For noise-free problems, where good pre-conditioners are not known a priori, iterative linear algebra methods offer one way to efficiently construct them.

We propose an iterative algorithm inspired by classic iterative linear solvers that uses a probabilistic model to actively infer a pre-conditioner in situations where Hessian-projections can only be constructed with strong Gaussian noise. The algorithm is empirically demonstrated to efficiently construct effective pre-conditioners for stochastic gradient descent and its variants. Experiments on problems of comparably low dimensionality show improved convergence. In very high-dimensional problems, such as those encountered in deep learning, the pre-conditioner effectively becomes an automatic learning-rate adaptation scheme, which we also empirically show to work well.",

      "abstract": "Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalogra-phy (EEG) are non-invasive modalities that measure the weak electromagnetic fields generated by neural activity. Inferring the location of the current sources that generated these magnetic fields is an ill-posed inverse problem known as source imaging. When considering a group study, a baseline approach consists in carrying out the estimation of these sources independently for each subject. The ill-posedness of each problem is typically addressed using sparsity promoting regularizations. A straightforward way to define a common pattern for these sources is then to average them. A more advanced alternative relies on a joint localization of sources for all subjects taken together, by enforcing some similarity across all estimated sources. An important advantage of this approach is that it consists in a single estimation in which all measurements are pooled together, making the inverse problem better posed. Such a joint estimation poses however a few challenges, notably the selection of a valid regularizer that can quantify such spatial similarities. We propose in this work a new procedure that can do so while taking into account the geometrical structure of the cortex. We call this procedure Minimum Wasserstein Estimates (MWE). The benefits of this model are twofold. First, joint inference allows to pool together the data of different brain geometries, accumulating more spatial information. Second, MWE are defined through Optimal Transport (OT) metrics which provide a tool to model spatial proximity between cortical sources of different subjects, hence not enforcing identical source location in the group. These benefits allow MWE to be more accurate than standard MEG source localization techniques. To support these claims, we perform source localization on realistic MEG simulations based on forward operators derived from MRI scans. On a visual task dataset, we demonstrate how MWE infer neural patterns similar to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) maps.",

This agent minimises a variational free energy bound on the average surprise of its sensations, which is motivated by a homeostatic argument. It does so by optimising the parameters of a generative latent variable model of its sensory inputs, together with a variational density approximating the posterior distribution over the latent variables, given its observations, and by acting on its environment to actively sample input that is likely under this generative model. The internal dynamics of the agent are implemented using deep and recurrent neural networks, as used in machine learning, making the deep active inference agent a scalable and very flexible class of active inference agent. Using the mountain car problem, we show how goal directed behaviour can be implemented by defining appropriate priors on the latent states in the agent's model. Furthermore, we show that the deep active inference agent can learn a generative model of the environment, which can be sampled from to understand the agent's beliefs about the environment and its interaction therewith.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is emerging as a possible unifying theory of perception and action in cognitive and computational neuroscience. On this theory, perception is a process of inferring the causes of sensory data by minimising the error between actual sensations and those predicted by an inner \\emph{generative} (probabilistic) model. Action on the other hand is drawn as a process that modifies the world such that the consequent sensory input meets expectations encoded in the same internal model. These two processes, inferring properties of the world and inferring actions needed to meet expectations, close the sensory/motor loop and suggest a deep symmetry between action and perception. In this work we present a simple agent-based model inspired by this new theory that offers insights on some of its central ideas. Previous implementations of active inference have typically examined a \"perception-oriented\" view of this theory, assuming that agents are endowed with a detailed generative model of their surrounding environment. In contrast, we present an \"action-oriented\" solution showing how adaptive behaviour can emerge even when agents operate with a simple model which bears little resemblance to their environment. We examine how various parameters of this formulation allow phototaxis and present an example of a different, \"pathological\" behaviour.",

Our main contribution is a method that translates a check-in activity into an information need, which is in turn addressed with an appropriate information card. This task is challenging because of the large number of possible activities and related information needs, which need to be addressed in a mobile dashboard that is limited in size. Our approach considers each possible activity that might follow after the last (and already finished) activity, and selects the top information cards such that they maximize the likelihood of satisfying the user's information needs for all possible future scenarios.

This posits that even-dimensional homology represents stable Structure/Context (e.g., generative models), while odd-dimensional homology represents dynamic Flow/Content (e.g., sensory/memory data). Cognition is governed by the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), a dynamical cycle aligning these parities. This framework distinguishes two modes: Inference (waking), where the scaffold predicts the flow (a Context-before-Content process); and Learning (sleep), an inverted Structure-before-Specificity process where memory traces sculpt the scaffold. This parity interpretation unifies cognitive functions like semantic and episodic memory and provides a structural generalization of existing theories, recasting Friston's Free Energy Principle and Tonini's Integrated Information in topological terms.",

The characteristics of a Darwinian process are developed including the consequences of accumulated adaptations resulting in adaptive systems operating in accordance with Friston's free energy principle and employing environmental simulations. Quantum theory, as developed in Zurek's research program and encapsulated by his theory of Quantum Darwinism is discussed from the view that Zurek's derivation of the measurement axioms implies that the evolution of a quantum system entangled with environmental entities is determined solely by the nature of the entangled system. There need be no further logical foundation. Quantum Darwinism is found to conform to the Darwinian paradigm in unexpected detail and is thus may be considered a theory within the framework of Universal Darwinism. With the inclusion of Quantum Darwinism within Universal Darwinism and the explanatory power of Darwinian processes extended beyond biology and the social sciences to include the creation and evolution of scientific subject matter within particle physics, atomic physics and chemistry, it is suggested that Universal Darwinism may be considered a candidate 'Theory of Everything' as anticipated by David Deutsch.",

      "abstract": "Although exploratory behaviors are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, their computational underpinnings are still largely unknown. Behavioral Psychology has identified learning as a primary drive underlying many exploratory behaviors. Exploration is seen as a means for an animal to gather sensory data useful for reducing its ignorance about the environment. While related problems have been addressed in Data Mining and Reinforcement Learning, the computational modeling of learning-driven exploration by embodied agents is largely unrepresented.   Here, we propose a computational theory for learning-driven exploration based on the concept of missing information that allows an agent to identify informative actions using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that when embodiment constraints are high, agents must actively coordinate their actions to learn efficiently. Compared to earlier approaches, our exploration policy yields more efficient learning across a range of worlds with diverse structures. The improved learning in turn affords greater success in general tasks including navigation and reward gathering. We conclude by discussing how the proposed theory relates to previous information-theoretic objectives of behavior, such as predictive information and the free energy principle, and how it might contribute to a general theory of exploratory behavior.",

      "abstract": "With the growing number of the elderly, we see a greater demand for home care, and the vision of pervasive computing is also floating into the domain of the household that aims to build a smart home which can assist inhabitants (users) to live more conveniently and harmoniously. Such health-care pervasive applications in smart home should focus on the inhabitant's goal or task in diverse situations, rather than the various complex devices and services. The core challenge for homecare design is to perceive the environment and assess occurring situations, thus allowing systems to behave intelligently according to the user's intent. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of pervasive computing environment, it is difficult for an average user to obtain right information and service and in right place at right time. This paper proposes a context-driven task-oriented middleware (CDTOM) to meet the challenge. The most important component is its task model that provides an adequate high-level description of user-oriented tasks and their related contexts. Leveraging the model multiple entities can easily exchange, share and reuse their knowledge. Based on the hierarchy of task ontology, a novel task recognition approach using CBR (case-based reasoning) is presented and the performance of task recognition is evaluated by task number, context size and time costing. Moreover, a dynamic mechanism for mapping the recognized task and services is also discussed. Finally, we present the design and implementation of our task supporting system (TSS) to aid an inhabitant's tasks in light of his lifestyle and environment conditions in pervasive homecare environment, and the results of the prototype system show that our middleware approach achieves good efficiency of context management and good accuracy of user's activity inference, and can improve efficiently quality of user's life.",

We find that specialization allows to focus on fewer tasks, thus leading to a more efficient execution, but in turn requires coordination in hierarchical structures of specialized experts and coordinating units.

We approach these questions about the living using concepts and tools from machine learning and developmental robotics. We argue that curiosity-driven learning enables organisms to make discoveries to solve complex problems with rare or deceptive rewards. By fostering exploration and discovery of a diversity of behavioural skills, and ignoring these rewards, curiosity can be efficient to bootstrap learning when there is no information, or deceptive information, about local improvement towards these problems. We also explain the key role of curiosity for efficient learning of world models. We review both normative and heuristic computational frameworks used to understand the mechanisms of curiosity in humans, conceptualizing the child as a sense-making organism. These frameworks enable us to discuss the bi-directional causal links between curiosity and learning, and to provide new hypotheses about the fundamental role of curiosity in self-organizing developmental structures through curriculum learning. We present various developmental robotics experiments that study these mechanisms in action, both supporting these hypotheses to understand better curiosity in humans and opening new research avenues in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Finally, we discuss challenges for the design of experimental paradigms for studying curiosity in psychology and cognitive neuroscience.

      "abstract": "Active inference is an ambitious theory that treats perception, inference and action selection of autonomous agents under the heading of a single principle. It suggests biologically plausible explanations for many cognitive phenomena, including consciousness. In active inference, action selection is driven by an objective function that evaluates possible future actions with respect to current, inferred beliefs about the world. Active inference at its core is independent from extrinsic rewards, resulting in a high level of robustness across e.g.\\ different environments or agent morphologies. In the literature, paradigms that share this independence have been summarised under the notion of intrinsic motivations. In general and in contrast to active inference, these models of motivation come without a commitment to particular inference and action selection mechanisms. In this article, we study if the inference and action selection machinery of active inference can also be used by alternatives to the originally included intrinsic motivation. The perception-action loop explicitly relates inference and action selection to the environment and agent memory, and is consequently used as foundation for our analysis. We reconstruct the active inference approach, locate the original formulation within, and show how alternative intrinsic motivations can be used while keeping many of the original features intact. Furthermore, we illustrate the connection to universal reinforcement learning by means of our formalism. Active inference research may profit from comparisons of the dynamics induced by alternative intrinsic motivations. Research on intrinsic motivations may profit from an additional way to implement intrinsically motivated agents that also share the biological plausibility of active inference.",

We suggest that, in addition to enhancing human cognitive functions with an intelligent and adaptive interface, integrated cognitive processing could accelerate emergent properties within artificial intelligence. To establish this, a machine learning part learns to integrate into human cognition by explaining away multi-modal sensory measurements from the environment and physiology simultaneously with the brain signal. With ongoing training, the amount of predictable brain signal increases. This lends the agent the ability to self-supervise on increasingly high levels of cognitive processing in order to further minimize surprise in predicting the brain signal. Furthermore, with increasing level of integration, the access to sensory information about environment and physiology is substituted with access to their representation in the brain. While integrating into a joint embodiment of human and machine, human action and perception are treated as the machine's own. The framework can be implemented with invasive as well as non-invasive sensors for environment, body and brain interfacing. Online and offline training with different machine learning approaches are thinkable. Building on previous research on shared representation learning, we suggest a first implementation leading towards hybrid active inference with non-invasive brain interfacing and state of the art probabilistic deep learning methods. We further discuss how implementation might have effect on the meta-cognitive abilities of the described agent and suggest that with adequate implementation the machine part can continue to execute and build upon the learned cognitive processes autonomously.",

      "abstract": "Collaborative machine learning and related techniques such as federated learning allow multiple participants, each with his own training dataset, to build a joint model by training locally and periodically exchanging model updates. We demonstrate that these updates leak unintended information about participants' training data and develop passive and active inference attacks to exploit this leakage. First, we show that an adversarial participant can infer the presence of exact data points -- for example, specific locations -- in others' training data (i.e., membership inference). Then, we show how this adversary can infer properties that hold only for a subset of the training data and are independent of the properties that the joint model aims to capture. For example, he can infer when a specific person first appears in the photos used to train a binary gender classifier. We evaluate our attacks on a variety of tasks, datasets, and learning configurations, analyze their limitations, and discuss possible defenses.",

Under a constraint on the number of processes that can be probed simultaneously, the decision maker should decide which processes to probe at each time and when to terminate the probing. Compared with previous work considering only the observation costs, the switching costs of switchings across processes also need to be taken into account in many practical scenarios. The objective is an active inference strategy that minimizes the Bayesian risk taking into account of the sample complexity, switching cost, as well as detection errors. Based on the framework of sequential design of experiments, we propose a low-complexity, low-switching deterministic policy for two scenarios where the total switching cost is negligible and the total switching cost is comparable to the total observation cost. We show that the proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the former scenario and is order optimal in the latter scenario. Simulation results demonstrate strong performance in the finite regime for both scenarios.",

      "abstract": "The predictive processing (PP) hypothesizes that the predictive inference of our sensorimotor system is encoded implicitly in the regularities between perception and action. We propose a neural architecture in which such regularities of active inference are encoded hierarchically. We further suggest that this encoding emerges during the embodied learning process when the appropriate action is selected to minimize the prediction error in perception. Therefore, this predictive stream in the sensorimotor loop is generated in a top-down manner. Specifically, it is constantly modulated by the motor actions and is updated by the bottom-up prediction error signals. In this way, the top-down prediction originally comes from the prior experience from both perception and action representing the higher levels of this hierarchical cognition. In our proposed embodied model, we extend the PredNet Network, a hierarchical predictive coding network, with the motor action units implemented by a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) to modulate the network top-down prediction. Two experiments, a minimalistic world experiment, and a mobile robot experiment are conducted to evaluate the proposed model in a qualitative way. In the neural representation, it can be observed that the causal inference of predictive percept from motor actions can be also observed while the agent is interacting with the environment.",

As a result, only a fraction of time is spent actually applying techniques to discover, control and predict the business process. Moreover, there is a lack of techniques to display relationships on top of databases without the need to express a complex query to get the required information. In this paper, a novel modeling technique that works on top of databases is presented. This technique is able to show a multigraph representing activities inferred from database events, connected with edges that are annotated with frequency and performance information. The representation may be the entry point to apply advanced process mining techniques that work on classic event logs, as the model provides a simple way to retrieve a classic event log from a specified piece of model.

REPRISE infers the unobservable contextual event state and accompanying temporal predictive models that best explain the recently encountered sensorimotor experiences retrospectively. Meanwhile, it optimizes upcoming motor activities prospectively in a goal-directed manner. Here, REPRISE is implemented by a recurrent neural network (RNN), which learns temporal forward models of the sensorimotor contingencies generated by different simulated dynamic vehicles. The RNN is augmented with contextual neurons, which enable the encoding of distinct, but related, sensorimotor dynamics as compact event codes. We show that REPRISE concurrently learns to separate and approximate the encountered sensorimotor dynamics: it analyzes sensorimotor error signals adapting both internal contextual neural activities and connection weight values. Moreover, we show that REPRISE can exploit the learned model to induce goal-directed, model-predictive control, that is, approximate active inference: Given a goal state, the system imagines a motor command sequence optimizing it with the prospective objective to minimize the distance to the goal. The RNN activities thus continuously imagine the upcoming future and reflect on the recent past, optimizing the predictive model, the hidden neural state activities, and the upcoming motor activities. As a result, event-predictive neural encodings develop, which allow the invocation of highly effective and adaptive goal-directed sensorimotor control.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of sensorimotor delays in the optimal control of (smooth) eye movements under uncertainty. Specifically, we consider delays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active inference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filtering to provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalized coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalized coordinates provides a simple way of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays. The efficacy of this scheme is illustrated using neuronal simulations of pursuit initiation responses, with and without compensation. We then consider an extension of the gener-ative model to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements - in which the visuo-oculomotor system believes both the target and its centre of gaze are attracted to a (hidden) point moving in the visual field. Finally, the generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can recognise and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from different sources with different temporal delays and the particular difficulties encountered when a system - like the oculomotor system - tries to control its environment with delayed signals.",

We present a fast online active set method to solve this sparse non-negative deconvolution problem. Importantly, the algorithm progresses through each time series sequentially from beginning to end, thus enabling real-time online estimation of neural activity during the imaging session. Our algorithm is a generalization of the pool adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA) for isotonic regression and inherits its linear-time computational complexity. We gain remarkable increases in processing speed: more than one order of magnitude compared to currently employed state of the art convex solvers relying on interior point methods. Unlike these approaches, our method can exploit warm starts; therefore optimizing model hyperparameters only requires a handful of passes through the data. A minor modification can further improve the quality of activity inference by imposing a constraint on the minimum spike size. The algorithm enables real-time simultaneous deconvolution of $O(10^5)$ traces of whole-brain larval zebrafish imaging data on a laptop.",

The objective is to design a sequential probing strategy that dynamically determines which processes to observe at each time and when to terminate the search so that the expected detection time is minimized under a constraint on the probability of misclassifying any process. This problem falls into the general setting of sequential design of experiments pioneered by Chernoff in 1959, in which a randomized strategy, referred to as the Chernoff test, was proposed and shown to be asymptotically optimal as the error probability approaches zero. For the problem considered in this paper, a low-complexity deterministic test is shown to enjoy the same asymptotic optimality while offering significantly better performance in the finite regime and faster convergence to the optimal rate function, especially when the number of processes is large.

      "abstract": "Robots operate in environments with varying implicit structure. For instance, a helicopter flying over terrain encounters a very different arrangement of obstacles than a robotic arm manipulating objects on a cluttered table top. State-of-the-art motion planning systems do not exploit this structure, thereby expending valuable planning effort searching for implausible solutions. We are interested in planning algorithms that actively infer the underlying structure of the valid configuration space during planning in order to find solutions with minimal effort. Consider the problem of evaluating edges on a graph to quickly discover collision-free paths. Evaluating edges is expensive, both for robots with complex geometries like robot arms, and for robots with limited onboard computation like UAVs. Until now, this challenge has been addressed via laziness i.e. deferring edge evaluation until absolutely necessary, with the hope that edges turn out to be valid. However, all edges are not alike in value - some have a lot of potentially good paths flowing through them, and some others encode the likelihood of neighbouring edges being valid. This leads to our key insight - instead of passive laziness, we can actively choose edges that reduce the uncertainty about the validity of paths. We show that this is equivalent to the Bayesian active learning paradigm of decision region determination (DRD). However, the DRD problem is not only combinatorially hard, but also requires explicit enumeration of all possible worlds. We propose a novel framework that combines two DRD algorithms, DIRECT and BISECT, to overcome both issues. We show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms on a spectrum of planning problems for mobile robots, manipulators and autonomous helicopters.",

A qualitative explanation for this finding is suggested. Nonlinear analysis of dynamo-waves reveals the hysteresis phenomenon found earlier in more advanced models.

      "abstract": "Every day, billions of mobile network events (i.e. CDRs) are generated by cellular phone operator companies. Latent in this data are inspiring insights about human actions and behaviors, the discovery of which is important because context-aware applications and services hold the key to user-driven, intelligent services, which can enhance our everyday lives such as social and economic development, urban planning, and health prevention. The major challenge in this area is that interpreting such a big stream of data requires a deep understanding of mobile network events' context through available background knowledge. This article addresses the issues in context awareness given heterogeneous and uncertain data of mobile network events missing reliable information on the context of this activity. The contribution of this research is a model from a combination of logical and statistical reasoning standpoints for enabling human activity inference in qualitative terms from open geographical data that aimed at improving the quality of human behaviors recognition tasks from CDRs. We use open geographical data, Openstreetmap (OSM), as a proxy for predicting the content of human activity in the area. The user study performed in Trento shows that predicted human activities (top level) match the survey data with around 93% overall accuracy. The extensive validation for predicting a more specific economic type of human activity performed in Barcelona, by employing credit card transaction data. The analysis identifies that appropriately normalized data on points of interest (POI) is a good proxy for predicting human economical activities, with 84% accuracy on average. So the model is proven to be efficient for predicting the context of human activity, when its total level could be efficiently observed from cell phone data records, missing contextual information however.",

Mathematically, such approaches are governed by a variational free energy principle and allow solving MDP planning problems with information-processing constraints expressed in terms of a Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to a reference distribution. Here we consider a generalization of such MDP planners by taking model uncertainty into account. As model uncertainty can also be formalized as an information-processing constraint, we can derive a unified solution from a single generalized variational principle. We provide a generalized value iteration scheme together with a convergence proof. As limit cases, this generalized scheme includes standard value iteration with a known model, Bayesian MDP planning, and robust planning. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in a grid world simulation.",

      "abstract": "Research on the so-called \"free-energy principle'' (FEP) in cognitive neuroscience is becoming increasingly high-profile. To date, introductions to this theory have proved difficult for many readers to follow, but it depends mainly upon two relatively simple ideas: firstly that normative or teleological values can be expressed as probability distributions (active inference), and secondly that approximate Bayesian reasoning can be effectively performed by gradient descent on model parameters (the free-energy principle). The notion of active inference is of great interest for a number of disciplines including cognitive science and artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive neuroscience, and deserves to be more widely known.   This paper attempts to provide an accessible introduction to active inference and informational free-energy, for readers from a range of scientific backgrounds. In this work introduce an agent-based model with an agent trying to make predictions about its position in a one-dimensional discretized world using methods from the FEP.",

      "abstract": "The active inference framework, and in particular its recent formulation as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), has gained increasing popularity in recent years as a useful approach for modeling neurocognitive processes. This framework is highly general and flexible in its ability to be customized to model any cognitive process, as well as simulate predicted neuronal responses based on its accompanying neural process theory. It also affords both simulation experiments for proof of principle and behavioral modeling for empirical studies. However, there are limited resources that explain how to build and run these models in practice, which limits their widespread use. Most introductions assume a technical background in programming, mathematics, and machine learning. In this paper we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to build POMDPs, run simulations using standard MATLAB routines, and fit these models to empirical data. We assume a minimal background in programming and mathematics, thoroughly explain all equations, and provide exemplar scripts that can be customized for both theoretical and empirical studies. Our goal is to provide the reader with the requisite background knowledge and practical tools to apply active inference to their own research. We also provide optional technical sections and multiple appendices, which offer the interested reader additional technical details. This tutorial should provide the reader with all the tools necessary to use these models and to follow emerging advances in active inference research.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The positive-negative axis of emotional valence has long been recognized as fundamental to adaptive behavior, but its origin and underlying function have largely eluded formal theorizing and computational modeling. Using deep active inference, a hierarchical inference scheme that rests on inverting a model of how sensory data are generated, we develop a principled Bayesian model of emotional valence. This formulation asserts that agents infer their valence state based on the expected precision of their action model—an internal estimate of overall model fitness (“subjective fitness”). This index of subjective fitness can be estimated within any environment and exploits the domain generality of second-order beliefs (beliefs about beliefs). We show how maintaining internal valence representations allows the ensuing affective agent to optimize confidence in action selection preemptively. Valence representations can in turn be optimized by leveraging the (Bayes-optimal) updating term for subjective fitness, which we label affective charge (AC). AC tracks changes in fitness estimates and lends a sign to otherwise unsigned divergences between predictions and outcomes. We simulate the resulting affective inference by subjecting an in silico affective agent to a T-maze paradigm requiring context learning, followed by context reversal. This formulation of affective inference offers a principled account of the link between affect, (mental) action, and implicit metacognition. It characterizes how a deep biological system can infer its affective state and reduce uncertainty about such inferences through internal action (i.e., top-down modulation of priors that underwrite confidence). Thus, we demonstrate the potential of active inference to provide a formal and computationally tractable account of affect. Our demonstration of the face validity and potential utility of this formulation represents the first step within a larger research program. Next, this model can be leveraged to test the hypothesized role of valence by fitting the model to behavioral and neuronal responses.",

      "abstract": "Converging theories suggest that organisms learn and exploit probabilistic models of their environment. However, it remains unclear how such models can be learned in practice. The open-ended complexity of natural environments means that it is generally infeasible for organisms to model their environment comprehensively. Alternatively, action-oriented models attempt to encode a parsimonious representation of adaptive agent-environment interactions. One approach to learning action-oriented models is to learn online in the presence of goal-directed behaviours. This constrains an agent to behaviourally relevant trajectories, reducing the diversity of the data a model need account for. Unfortunately, this approach can cause models to prematurely converge to sub-optimal solutions, through a process we refer to as a bad-bootstrap. Here, we exploit the normative framework of active inference to show that efficient action-oriented models can be learned by balancing goal-oriented and epistemic (information-seeking) behaviours in a principled manner. We illustrate our approach using a simple agent-based model of bacterial chemotaxis. We first demonstrate that learning via goal-directed behaviour indeed constrains models to behaviorally relevant aspects of the environment, but that this approach is prone to sub-optimal convergence. We then demonstrate that epistemic behaviours facilitate the construction of accurate and comprehensive models, but that these models are not tailored to any specific behavioural niche and are therefore less efficient in their use of data. Finally, we show that active inference agents learn models that are parsimonious, tailored to action, and which avoid bad bootstraps and sub-optimal convergence. Critically, our results indicate that models learned through active inference can support adaptive behaviour in spite of, and indeed because of, their departure from veridical representations of the environment. Our approach provides a principled method for learning adaptive models from limited interactions with an environment, highlighting a route to sample efficient learning algorithms.",

Since then, active inference has fueled both representationalist and dynamicist campaigns. However, we believe that when diving into the formal details of active inference, one should be able to find a solution to the war; if not a peace treaty, surely an armistice of a sort. Based on an analysis of these formal details, this paper shows how both representationalist and dynamicist sensibilities can peacefully coexist within the new territory of active inference.",

Active inference is based on the premise that afferent sensory input to the brain is constantly shaped and modified by prior expectations. In this review we propose that interoceptive psychopathology results from two primary interoceptive dysfunctions: First, individuals have abnormally strong expectations of the situations that elicit bodily change (i.e., hyperprecise priors), and second, they have great difficulty adjusting these expectations when the environment changes (i.e., context rigidity). Here we discuss how these dysfunctions potentially manifest in mental illness and how interventions aimed at altering interoceptive processing can help the brain create a more realistic model of its internal state.",

We argue that these constructs have been systematically misrepresented in the literature, because of the conflation between the FEP and active inference, on the one hand, and distinct (albeit closely related) Bayesian formulations, centred on the brain – variously known as predictive processing, predictive coding or the prediction error minimisation framework. More specifically, we examine two contrasting interpretations of these models: a structural representationalist interpretation and an enactive interpretation. We argue that the structural representationalist interpretation of generative and recognition models does not do justice to the role that these constructs play in active inference under the FEP. We propose an enactive interpretation of active inference – what might be called enactive inference. In active inference under the FEP, the generative and recognition models are best cast as realising inference and control – the self-organising, belief-guided selection of action policies – and do not have the properties ascribed by structural representationalists.",

This paper offers a normative framework to answer this question. We introduce the computational construct of 'deontic value' - based on active inference and Markov decision processes - to formalize conceptions of social conformity and human decision-making. Deontic value is an attribute of choices, behaviors, or action sequences that inherit directly from deontic cues in our econiche (e.g., red traffic lights); namely, cues that denote an obligatory social rule. Crucially, the prosocial aspect of deontic value rests upon a particular form of circular causality: deontic cues exist in the environment in virtue of the environment being modified by repeated actions, while action itself is contingent upon the deontic value of environmental cues. We argue that this construction of deontic cues enables the epistemic (i.e., information-seeking) and pragmatic (i.e., goal- seeking) values of any behavior to be 'cached' or 'outsourced' to the environment, where the environment effectively 'learns' about the behavior of its denizens. We describe the process whereby this particular aspect of value enables learning of habitual behavior over neurodevelopmental and transgenerational timescales.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Meta-awareness refers to the capacity to explicitly notice the current content of consciousness and has been identified as a key component for the successful control of cognitive states, such as the deliberate direction of attention. This paper proposes a formal model of meta-awareness and attentional control using hierarchical active inference. To do so, we cast mental action as policy selection over higher-level cognitive states and add a further hierarchical level to model meta-awareness states that modulate the expected confidence (precision) in the mapping between observations and hidden cognitive states. We simulate the example of mind-wandering and its regulation during a task involving sustained selective attention on a perceptual object. This provides a computational case study for an inferential architecture that is apt to enable the emergence of these central components of human phenomenology, namely, the ability to access and control cognitive states. We propose that this approach can be generalized to other cognitive states, and hence, this paper provides the first steps towards the development of a computational phenomenology of mental action and more broadly of our ability to monitor and control our own cognitive states. Future steps of this work will focus on fitting the model with qualitative, behavioural, and neural data.",

      "abstract": "Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) is a useful but challenging task. It is a promising idea to design BIQA methods by mimicking the working mechanism of human visual system (HVS). The internal generative mechanism (IGM) indicates that the HVS actively infers the primary content (i.e., meaningful information) of an image for better understanding. Inspired by that, this paper presents a novel BIQA metric by mimicking the active inference process of IGM. Firstly, an active inference module based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) is established to predict the primary content, in which the semantic similarity and the structural dissimilarity (i.e., semantic consistency and structural completeness) are both considered during the optimization. Then, the image quality is measured on the basis of its primary content. Generally, the image quality is highly related to three aspects, i.e., the scene information (content-dependency), the distortion type (distortion-dependency), and the content degradation (degradation-dependency). According to the correlation between the distorted image and its primary content, the three aspects are analyzed and calculated respectively with a multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) based quality evaluator. As a result, with the help of the primary content obtained from the active inference and the comprehensive quality degradation measurement from the multi-stream CNN, our method achieves competitive performance on five popular IQA databases. Especially in cross-database evaluations, our method achieves significant improvements.",

      "abstract": "The descending projections from motor cortex share many features with top-down or backward connections in visual cortex; for example, corticospinal projections originate in infragranular layers, are highly divergent and (along with descending cortico-cortical projections) target cells expressing NMDA receptors. This is somewhat paradoxical because backward modulatory characteristics would not be expected of driving motor command signals. We resolve this apparent paradox using a functional characterisation of the motor system based on Helmholtz's ideas about perception; namely, that perception is inference on the causes of visual sensations. We explain behaviour in terms of inference on the causes of proprioceptive sensations. This explanation appeals to active inference, in which higher cortical levels send descending proprioceptive predictions, rather than motor commands. This process mirrors perceptual inference in sensory cortex, where descending connections convey predictions, while ascending connections convey prediction errors. The anatomical substrate of this recurrent message passing is a hierarchical system consisting of functionally asymmetric driving (ascending) and modulatory (descending) connections: an arrangement that we show is almost exactly recapitulated in the motor system, in terms of its laminar, topographic and physiological characteristics. This perspective casts classical motor reflexes as minimising prediction errors and may provide a principled explanation for why motor cortex is agranular.",

      "abstract": "Active inference provides a simple and neurobiologically plausible account of how action and perception are coupled in producing (Bayes) optimal behaviour. This can be seen most easily as minimising prediction error: we can either change our predictions to explain sensory input through perception. Alternatively, we can actively change sensory input to fulfil our predictions. In active inference, this action is mediated by classical reflex arcs that minimise proprioceptive prediction error created by descending proprioceptive predictions. However, this creates a conflict between action and perception; in that, self-generated movements require predictions to override the sensory evidence that one is not actually moving. However, ignoring sensory evidence means that externally generated sensations will not be perceived. Conversely, attending to (proprioceptive and somatosensory) sensations enables the detection of externally generated events but precludes generation of actions. This conflict can be resolved by attenuating the precision of sensory evidence during movement or, equivalently, attending away from the consequences of self-made acts. We propose that this Bayes optimal withdrawal of precise sensory evidence during movement is the cause of psychophysical sensory attenuation. Furthermore, it explains the force-matching illusion and reproduces empirical results almost exactly. Finally, if attenuation is removed, the force-matching illusion disappears and false (delusional) inferences about agency emerge. This is important, given the negative correlation between sensory attenuation and delusional beliefs in normal subjects--and the reduction in the magnitude of the illusion in schizophrenia. Active inference therefore links the neuromodulatory optimisation of precision to sensory attenuation and illusory phenomena during the attribution of agency in normal subjects. It also provides a functional account of deficits in syndromes characterised by false inference and impaired movement--like schizophrenia and Parkinsonism--syndromes that implicate abnormal modulatory neurotransmission.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers agency in the setting of embodied or active inference. In brief, we associate a sense of agency with prior beliefs about action and ask what sorts of beliefs underlie optimal behavior. In particular, we consider prior beliefs that action minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between desired states and attainable states in the future. This allows one to formulate bounded rationality as approximate Bayesian inference that optimizes a free energy bound on model evidence. We show that constructs like expected utility, exploration bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of this formulation. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding and Bayesian filtering schemes for minimizing free energy. Here, we consider variational Bayes as an alternative scheme that provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and action-constraints that are remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Furthermore, this scheme contextualizes optimal decision theory and economic (utilitarian) formulations as pure inference problems. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimization, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (of softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solution-that minimizes free energy. This sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behavior, such that attainable goals are afforded a higher precision or confidence. In turn, this means that optimal behavior entails a representation of confidence about outcomes that are under an agent's control.",

We show that it is fairly simple to teach an agent complicated and adaptive behaviours using a free-energy formulation of perception. In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain.",

Here, we present an alternative view that frames the physiology of dopamine in terms of Bayes-optimal behaviour. In this account, dopamine controls the precision or salience of (external or internal) cues that engender action. In other words, dopamine balances bottom-up sensory information and top-down prior beliefs when making hierarchical inferences (predictions) about cues that have affordance. In this paper, we focus on the consequences of changing tonic levels of dopamine firing using simulations of cued sequential movements. Crucially, the predictions driving movements are based upon a hierarchical generative model that infers the context in which movements are made. This means that we can confuse agents by changing the context (order) in which cues are presented. These simulations provide a (Bayes-optimal) model of contextual uncertainty and set switching that can be quantified in terms of behavioural and electrophysiological responses. Furthermore, one can simulate dopaminergic lesions (by changing the precision of prediction errors) to produce pathological behaviours that are reminiscent of those seen in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. We use these simulations to demonstrate how a single functional role for dopamine at the synaptic level can manifest in different ways at the behavioural level.",

In this setting, reward or cost functions are absorbed into prior beliefs about state transitions and terminal states. Effectively, this converts optimal control into a pure inference problem, enabling the application of standard Bayesian filtering techniques. We then consider optimal trajectories that rest on posterior beliefs about hidden states in the future.

This leads to a distinction between models with and without inference on hidden control states; namely, agency-free and agency-based models, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Perception is the foundation of cognition and is fundamental to our beliefs and consequent action planning. The Editorial (this issue) asks: \"what mechanisms, if any, mediate between perceptual and cognitive processes?\" It has recently been argued that attention might furnish such a mechanism. In this paper, we pursue the idea that action planning (motor preparation) is an attentional phenomenon directed toward kinesthetic signals. This rests on a view of motor control as active inference, where predictions of proprioceptive signals are fulfilled by peripheral motor reflexes. If valid, active inference suggests that attention should not be limited to the optimal biasing of perceptual signals in the exteroceptive (e.g., visual) domain but should also bias proprioceptive signals during movement. Here, we investigate this idea using a classical attention (Posner) paradigm cast in a motor setting. Specially, we looked for decreases in reaction times when movements were preceded by valid relative to invalid cues. Furthermore, we addressed the hierarchical level at which putative attentional effects were expressed by independently cueing the nature of the movement and the hand used to execute it. We found a significant interaction between the validity of movement and effector cues on reaction times. This suggests that attentional bias might be mediated at a low level in the motor hierarchy, in an intrinsic frame of reference. This finding is consistent with attentional enabling of top-down predictions of proprioceptive input and may rely upon the same synaptic mechanisms that mediate directed spatial attention in the visual system.",

Despite the inextricable link between emotion and cognition, emotion has not yet been formulated under this framework. A core concept that permeates many perspectives on emotion is valence, which broadly refers to the positive and negative character of emotion or some of its aspects. In the present paper, we propose a definition of emotional valence in terms of the negative rate of change of free-energy over time. If the second time-derivative of free-energy is taken into account, the dynamics of basic forms of emotion such as happiness, unhappiness, hope, fear, disappointment and relief can be explained. In this formulation, an important function of emotional valence turns out to regulate the learning rate of the causes of sensory inputs. When sensations increasingly violate the agent's expectations, valence is negative and increases the learning rate. Conversely, when sensations increasingly fulfil the agent's expectations, valence is positive and decreases the learning rate. This dynamic interaction between emotional valence and learning rate highlights the crucial role played by emotions in biological agents' adaptation to unexpected changes in their world.",

      "abstract": "The term “minimal phenomenal selfhood” (MPS) describes the basic, pre- reflective experience of being a self (Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Theoretical accounts of the minimal self have long recognized the importance and the ambivalence of the body as both part of the physical world, and the enabling condition for being in this world (Gallagher, 2005a; Grafton, 2009). A recent account of MPS (Metzinger, 2004a) centers on the consideration that minimal selfhood emerges as the result of basic self-modeling mechanisms, thereby being founded on pre-reflective bodily processes. The free energy principle (FEP; Friston, 2010) is a novel unified theory of cortical function built upon the imperative that self-organizing systems entail hierarchical generative models of the causes of their sensory input, which are optimized by minimizing free energy as an approximation of the log-likelihood of the model. The implementation of the FEP via predictive coding mechanisms and in particular the active inference principle emphasizes the role of embodiment for predictive self-modeling, which has been appreciated in recent publications. In this review, we provide an overview of these conceptions and illustrate thereby the potential power of the FEP in explaining the mechanisms underlying minimal selfhood and its key constituents, multisensory integration, interoception, agency, perspective, and the experience of mineness. We conclude that the conceptualization of MPS can be well mapped onto a hierarchical generative model furnished by the FEP and may constitute the basis for higher-level, cognitive forms of self-referral, as well as the understanding of other minds.",

      "abstract": "We have previously tried to explain perceptual inference and learning under a free-energy principle that pursues Helmholtz's agenda to understand the brain in terms of energy minimization. It is fairly easy to show that making inferences about the causes of sensory data can be cast as the minimization of a free-energy bound on the likelihood of sensory inputs, given an internal model of how they were caused. In this article, we consider what would happen if the data themselves were sampled to minimize this bound. It transpires that the ensuing active sampling or inference is mandated by ergodic arguments based on the very existence of adaptive agents. Furthermore, it accounts for many aspects of motor behavior; from retinal stabilization to goal-seeking. In particular, it suggests that motor control can be understood as fulfilling prior expectations about proprioceptive sensations. This formulation can explain why adaptive behavior emerges in biological agents and suggests a simple alternative to optimal control theory. We illustrate these points using simulations of oculomotor control and then apply to same principles to cued and goal-directed movements. In short, the free-energy formulation may provide an alternative perspective on the motor control that places it in an intimate relationship with perception.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Perceptual awareness depends upon the way in which we engage with our sensorium. This notion is central to active inference, a theoretical framework that treats perception and action as inferential processes. This variational perspective on cognition formalizes the notion of perception as hypothesis testing and treats actions as experiments that are designed (in part) to gather evidence for or against alternative hypotheses. The common treatment of perception and action affords a useful interpretation of certain perceptual phenomena whose active component is often not acknowledged. In this article, we start by considering Troxler fading – the dissipation of a peripheral percept during maintenance of fixation, and its recovery during free (saccadic) exploration. This offers an important example of the failure to maintain a percept without actively interrogating a visual scene. We argue that this may be understood in terms of the accumulation of uncertainty about a hypothesized stimulus when free exploration is disrupted by experimental instructions or pathology. Once we take this view, we can generalize the idea of using bodily (oculomotor) action to resolve uncertainty to include the use of mental (attentional) actions for the same purpose. This affords a useful way to think about binocular rivalry paradigms, in which perceptual changes need not be associated with an overt movement.",

      "abstract": "This paper combines recent formulations of self-organization and neuronal processing to provide an account of cognitive dynamics from basic principles. We start by showing that inference (and autopoiesis) are emergent features of any (weakly mixing) ergodic random dynamical system. We then apply the emergent dynamics to action and perception in a way that casts action as the fulfillment of (Bayesian) beliefs about the causes of sensations. More formally, we formulate ergodic flows on global random attractors as a generalized descent on a free energy functional of the internal states of a system. This formulation rests on a partition of states based on a Markov blanket that separates internal states from hidden states in the external milieu. This separation means that the internal states effectively represent external states probabilistically. The generalized descent is then related to classical Bayesian (e.g., Kalman-Bucy) filtering and predictive coding-of the sort that might be implemented in the brain. Finally, we present two simulations. The first simulates a primordial soup to illustrate the emergence of a Markov blanket and (active) inference about hidden states. The second uses the same emergent dynamics to simulate action and action observation.",

It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to Home sapiens , in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the active inference scheme—a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—all the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.",

The study of motivated control traditionally assumes a distinction between control and motivational processes, which map to distinct (dorsolateral versus ventromedial) brain systems. However, the respective roles and interactions between these processes remain controversial. We offer a novel perspective that casts control and motivational processes as complementary aspects - goal propagation and prioritization, respectively - of active inference and hierarchical goal processing under deep generative models. We propose that the control hierarchy propagates prior preferences or goals, but their precision is informed by the motivational context, inferred at different levels of the motivational hierarchy. The ensuing integration of control and motivational processes underwrites action and policy selection and, ultimately, motivated behaviour, by enabling deep inference to prioritize goals in a context-sensitive way.",

Our focus is on how epistemic behaviour-driven by novelty and the imperative to reduce uncertainty about the world-contextualises pragmatic or goal-directed behaviour. Using simulations, we illustrate the underlying process theory with synthetic behavioural and electrophysiological responses during exploration of a maze and subsequent navigation to a target location.

We propose a relationship of phenomenal opacity to expected uncertainty or precision; i.e., the capacity for introspective attention and implicit mental action. Thus we associate introspective attention with the deployment of 'precision' that may render the perceptual evidence (for action) opaque, while treating transparency as a necessary aspect of beliefs about action, i.e., 'what I am' doing. We conclude by proposing how we may have to nuance our conception of minimal phenomenal selfhood and agency in light of this active inference conception of transparency-opacity.",

      "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework (FEP-AI) begins with the understanding that persisting systems must regulate environmental exchanges and prevent entropic accumulation. In FEP-AI, minds and brains are predictive controllers for autonomous systems, where action-driven perception is realized as probabilistic inference. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) begins with considering the preconditions for a system to intrinsically exist, as well as axioms regarding the nature of consciousness. IIT has produced controversy because of its surprising entailments: quasi-panpsychism; subjectivity without referents or dynamics; and the possibility of fully-intelligent-yet-unconscious brain simulations. Here, I describe how these controversies might be resolved by integrating IIT with FEP-AI, where integrated information only entails consciousness for systems with perspectival reference frames capable of generating models with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence for self and world. Without that connection with external reality, systems could have arbitrarily high amounts of integrated information, but nonetheless would not entail subjective experience. I further describe how an integration of these frameworks may contribute to their evolution as unified systems theories and models of emergent causation. Then, inspired by both Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) and the Harmonic Brain Modes framework, I describe how streams of consciousness may emerge as an evolving generation of sensorimotor predictions, with the precise composition of experiences depending on the integration abilities of synchronous complexes as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs). These integrating dynamics may be particularly likely to occur via richly connected subnetworks affording body-centric sources of phenomenal binding and executive control. Along these connectivity backbones, SOHMs are proposed to implement turbo coding via loopy message-passing over predictive (autoencoding) networks, thus generating maximum a posteriori estimates as coherent vectors governing neural evolution, with alpha frequencies generating basic awareness, and cross-frequency phase-coupling within theta frequencies for access consciousness and volitional control. These dynamic cores of integrated information also function as global workspaces, centered on posterior cortices, but capable of being entrained with frontal cortices and interoceptive hierarchies, thus affording agentic causation. Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) represents a synthetic approach to understanding minds that reveals compatibility between leading theories of consciousness, thus enabling inferential synergy.",

We ask what sort of neuronal message passing is mandated by active inference—and what implications this has for context-sensitive connectivity at microscopic and macroscopic levels. In particular, we formulate neuronal processing as belief propagation under deep generative models. Crucially, these models can entertain both discrete and continuous states, leading to distinct schemes for belief updating that play out on the same (neuronal) architecture. Technically, we use Forney (normal) factor graphs to elucidate the requisite message passing in terms of its form and scheduling. To accommodate mixed generative models (of discrete and continuous states), one also has to consider link nodes or factors that enable discrete and continuous representations to talk to each other. When mapping the implicit computational architecture onto neuronal connectivity, several interesting features emerge. For example, Bayesian model averaging and comparison, which link discrete and continuous states, may be implemented in thalamocortical loops. These and other considerations speak to a computational connectome that is inherently state dependent and self-organizing in ways that yield to a principled (variational) account. We conclude with simulations of reading that illustrate the implicit neuronal message passing, with a special focus on how discrete (semantic) representations inform, and are informed by, continuous (visual) sampling of the sensorium.",

Despite noisy sensory data, and volatile environments, creatures appear to actively maintain their integrity. To account for this remarkable ability to make optimal decisions in the face of a capricious world, we propose a generative model that represents the beliefs an agent might possess about their own uncertainty. By simulating a noisy and volatile environment, we demonstrate how uncertainty influences optimal epistemic (visual) foraging. In our simulations, saccades were deployed less frequently to regions with a lower sensory precision, while a greater volatility led to a shorter inhibition of return.

Many see these theories as natural partners or as making similar statements about the nature of biological and cognitive systems. We critically examine these claims and identify a series of misreadings and misinterpretations of key enactive concepts. In particular, we notice a tendency to disregard the operational definition of autopoiesis and the distinction between a system’s structure and its organization. Other misreadings concern the conflation of processes of self-distinction in operationally closed systems and Markov blankets. Deeper theoretical tensions underlie some of these misinterpretations. FEP assumes systems that reach a non-equilibrium steady state and are enveloped by a Markov blanket. We argue that these assumptions contradict the historicity of sense-making that is explicit in the enactive approach. Enactive concepts such as adaptivity and agency are defined in terms of the modulation of parameters and constraints of the agent-environment coupling, which entail the possibility of changes in variable and parameter sets, constraints, and in the dynamical laws affecting the system. This allows enaction to address the path-dependent diversity of human bodies and minds. We argue that these ideas are incompatible with the time invariance of non-equilibrium steady states assumed by the FEP. In addition, the enactive perspective foregrounds the enabling and constitutive roles played by the world in sense-making, agency, development. We argue that this view of transactional and constitutive relations between organisms and environments is a challenge to the FEP. Once we move beyond superficial similarities, identify misreadings, and examine the theoretical commitments of the two approaches, we reach the conclusion that far from being easily integrated, the FEP, as it stands formulated today, is in tension with the theories of autopoiesis and enaction.\n\n\n",

      "abstract": "The term 'stress' - coined in 1936 - has many definitions, but until now has lacked a theoretical foundation. Here we present an information-theoretic approach - based on the 'free energy principle' - defining the essence of stress; namely, uncertainty. We address three questions: What is uncertainty? What does it do to us? What are our resources to master it? Mathematically speaking, uncertainty is entropy or 'expected surprise'. The 'free energy principle' rests upon the fact that self-organizing biological agents resist a tendency to disorder and must therefore minimize the entropy of their sensory states. Applied to our everyday life, this means that we feel uncertain, when we anticipate that outcomes will turn out to be something other than expected - and that we are unable to avoid surprise. As all cognitive systems strive to reduce their uncertainty about future outcomes, they face a critical constraint: Reducing uncertainty requires cerebral energy. The characteristic of the vertebrate brain to prioritize its own high energy is captured by the notion of the 'selfish brain'. Accordingly, in times of uncertainty, the selfish brain demands extra energy from the body. If, despite all this, the brain cannot reduce uncertainty, a persistent cerebral energy crisis may develop, burdening the individual by 'allostatic load' that contributes to systemic and brain malfunction (impaired memory, atherogenesis, diabetes and subsequent cardio- and cerebrovascular events). Based on the basic tenet that stress originates from uncertainty, we discuss the strategies our brain uses to avoid surprise and thereby resolve uncertainty.",

      "abstract": "Disruptions in the ordinary sense of selfhood underpin both pathological and \"enlightened\" states of consciousness. People suffering from depersonalization can experience the loss of a sense of self as devastating, often accompanied by intense feelings of alienation, fear, and hopelessness. However, for meditative contemplatives from various traditions, \"selfless\" experiences are highly sought after, being associated with enduring peace and joy. Little is understood about how these contrasting dysphoric and euphoric experiences should be conceptualized. In this paper, we propose a unified account of these selfless experiences within the active inference framework. Building on our recent active inference research, we propose an account of the experiences of selfhood as emerging from a temporally deep generative model. We go on to develop a view of the self as playing a central role in structuring ordinary experience by \"tuning\" agents to the counterfactually rich possibilities for action. Finally, we explore how depersonalization may result from an inferred loss of allostatic control and contrast this phenomenology with selfless experiences reported by meditation practitioners. We will show how, by beginning with a conception of self-modeling within an active inference framework, we have available to us a new way of conceptualizing the striking experiential similarities and important differences between these selfless experiences within a unifying theoretical framework. We will explore the implications for understanding and treating dissociative disorders, as well as elucidate both the therapeutic potential, and possible dangers, of meditation.",

The free-energy principle is a theoretical framework capturing the imperative for biological self-organization in information-theoretic terms. The free-energy principle has typically been connected with a Bayesian theory of predictive coding, and the latter is often taken to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception as unconscious inference. If our interpretation is right, however, a Helmholtzian view of perception is incompatible with Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle. We argue that the free energy principle and the ecological and enactive approach to mind and life make for a much happier marriage of ideas. We make our argument based on three points. First we argue that the free energy principle applies to the whole animal–environment system, and not only to the brain. Second, we show that active inference, as understood by the free-energy principle, is incompatible with unconscious inference understood as analagous to scientific hypothesis-testing, the main tenet of a Helmholtzian view of perception. Third, we argue that the notion of inference at work in Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle is too weak to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception. Taken together these points imply that the free energy principle is best understood in ecological and enactive terms set out in this paper.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new psychovisual quality metric of images based on recent developments in brain theory and neuroscience, particularly the free-energy principle. The perception and understanding of an image is modeled as an active inference process, in which the brain tries to explain the scene using an internal generative model. The psychovisual quality is thus closely related to how accurately visual sensory data can be explained by the generative model, and the upper bound of the discrepancy between the image signal and its best internal description is given by the free energy of the cognition process. Therefore, the perceptual quality of an image can be quantified using the free energy. Constructively, we develop a reduced-reference free-energy-based distortion metric (FEDM) and a no-reference free-energy-based quality metric (NFEQM). The FEDM and the NFEQM are nearly invariant to many global systematic deviations in geometry and illumination that hardly affect visual quality, for which existing image quality metrics wrongly predict severe quality degradation. Although with very limited or even without information on the reference image, the FEDM and the NFEQM are highly competitive compared with the full-reference SSIM image quality metric on images in the popular LIVE database. Moreover, FEDM and NFEQM can measure correctly the visual quality of some model-based image processing algorithms, for which the competing metrics often contradict with viewers' opinions.",

The existing pixel-based JND models mainly consider the orderly factors and always underestimate the JND threshold of the disorderly region. Recent research indicates that the human visual system (HVS) actively predicts the orderly information and avoids the residual disorderly uncertainty for image perception and understanding. Thus, we suggest that there exists disorderly concealment effect which results in high JND threshold of the disorderly region. Beginning with the Bayesian inference, we deduce an autoregressive model to imitate the active prediction of the HVS. Then, we estimate the disorderly concealment effect for the novel JND model. Experimental results confirm that the proposed JND model outperforms the relevant existing ones. Furthermore, we apply the proposed JND model in image compression, and around 15% of bit rate can be reduced without jeopardizing the perceptual quality.",

We then consider the implications of this approach for understanding depression. We speculate that depression is a disorder of allostasis, whose myriad symptoms result from a ‘locked in’ brain that is relatively insensitive to its sensory context. We conclude with a brief discussion of the ways our approach might reveal new insights for the treatment of depression.

      "abstract": "This paper describes an active inference scheme for visual searches and the perceptual synthesis entailed by scene construction. Active inference assumes that perception and action minimize variational free energy, where actions are selected to minimize the free energy expected in the future. This assumption generalizes risk-sensitive control and expected utility theory to include epistemic value; namely, the value (or salience) of information inherent in resolving uncertainty about the causes of ambiguous cues or outcomes. Here, we apply active inference to saccadic searches of a visual scene. We consider the (difficult) problem of categorizing a scene, based on the spatial relationship among visual objects where, crucially, visual cues are sampled myopically through a sequence of saccadic eye movements. This means that evidence for competing hypotheses about the scene has to be accumulated sequentially, calling upon both prediction (planning) and postdiction (memory). Our aim is to highlight some simple but fundamental aspects of the requisite functional anatomy; namely, the link between approximate Bayesian inference under mean field assumptions and functional segregation in the visual cortex. This link rests upon the (neurobiologically plausible) process theory that accompanies the normative formulation of active inference for Markov decision processes. In future work, we hope to use this scheme to model empirical saccadic searches and identify the prior beliefs that underwrite intersubject variability in the way people forage for information in visual scenes (e.g., in schizophrenia).",

However, existing DRL solutions suffer from data inefficiency, insensitivity to latency requirements, and non-adaptability to task load variations, which will degrade the performance of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on active inference for LLMs inference task offloading and resource allocation in cloud-edge computing.

Upon receiving electrical stimuli—generated by mixing two hidden sources—neurons self-organised to selectively encode the two sources. Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity. These results demonstrate the applicability of the free-energy principle to in vitro neural networks and establish its predictive validity in this setting.",

      "abstract": "Osteopathy is a person-centred healthcare discipline that emphasizes the body’s structure-function interrelationship—and its self-regulatory mechanisms—to inform a whole-person approach to health and wellbeing. This paper aims to provide a theoretical framework for developing an integrative hypothesis in osteopathy, which is based on the enactivist and active inference accounts. We propose that osteopathic care can be reconceptualised under (En)active inference as a unifying framework. Active inference suggests that action-perception cycles operate to minimize uncertainty and optimize an individual’s internal model of the lived world and, crucially, the consequences of their behaviour. We argue that (En)active inference offers an integrative framework for osteopathy, which can evince the mechanisms underlying dyadic and triadic (e.g., in paediatric care) exchanges and osteopathic care outcomes. We propose that this theoretical framework can underpin osteopathic care across the lifespan, from preterm infants to the elderly and those with persistent pain and other physical symptoms. In situations of chronicity, as an ecological niche, the patient-practitioner dyad provides the osteopath and the patient with a set of affordances, i.e., possibilities for action provided by the environment, that through shared intentionally, can promote adaptations and restoration of productive agency. Through a dyadic therapeutic relationship, as they engage with their ecological niche’s affordances—a structured set of affordances shared by agents—osteopath and patient actively construct a shared sense-making narrative and realise a shared generative model of their relation to the niche. In general, touch plays a critical role in developing a robust therapeutic alliance, mental state alignment, and biobehavioural synchrony between patient and practitioner. However, its role is particularly crucial in the fields of neonatology and paediatrics, where it becomes central in regulating allostasis and restoring homeostasis. We argue that from an active inference standpoint, the dyadic shared ecological niche underwrites a robust therapeutic alliance, which is crucial to the effectiveness of osteopathic care. Considerations and implications of this model—to clinical practice and research, both within- and outside osteopathy—are critically discussed.",

      "abstract": "This article offers a formal account of curiosity and insight in terms of active (Bayesian) inference. It deals with the dual problem of inferring states of the world and learning its statistical structure. In contrast to current trends in machine learning (e.g., deep learning), we focus on how people attain insight and understanding using just a handful of observations, which are solicited through curious behavior. We use simulations of abstract rule learning and approximate Bayesian inference to show that minimizing (expected) variational free energy leads to active sampling of novel contingencies. This epistemic behavior closes explanatory gaps in generative models of the world, thereby reducing uncertainty and satisfying curiosity. We then move from epistemic learning to model selection or structure learning to show how abductive processes emerge when agents test plausible hypotheses about symmetries (i.e., invariances or rules) in their generative models. The ensuing Bayesian model reduction evinces mechanisms associated with sleep and has all the hallmarks of “aha” moments. This formulation moves toward a computational account of consciousness in the pre-Cartesian sense of sharable knowledge (i.e., con: “together”; scire: “to know”).",

This is supported by studies where optogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons can stand in lieu of actual reward. Nevertheless, a large body of data also shows that dopamine is not necessary for learning, and that dopamine depletion primarily affects task performance. We offer a resolution to this paradox based on an hypothesis that dopamine encodes the precision of beliefs about alternative actions, and thus controls the outcome-sensitivity of behavior. We extend an active inference scheme for solving Markov decision processes to include learning, and show that simulated dopamine dynamics strongly resemble those actually observed during instrumental conditioning. Furthermore, simulated dopamine depletion impairs performance but spares learning, while simulated excitation of dopamine neurons drives reward learning, through aberrant inference about outcome states. Our formal approach provides a novel and parsimonious reconciliation of apparently divergent experimental findings.",

      "abstract": "The free-energy principle in recent studies of brain theory and neuroscience models the perception and understanding of the outside scene as an active inference process, in which the brain tries to account for the visual scene with an internal generative model. Specifically, with the internal generative model, the brain yields corresponding predictions for its encountered visual scenes. Then, the discrepancy between the visual input and its brain prediction should be closely related to the quality of perceptions. On the other hand, sparse representation has been evidenced to resemble the strategy of the primary visual cortex in the brain for representing natural images. With the strong neurobiological support for sparse representation, in this paper, we approximate the internal generative model with sparse representation and propose an image quality metric accordingly, which is named FSI (free-energy principle and sparse representation-based index for image quality assessment). In FSI, the reference and distorted images are, respectively, predicted by the sparse representation at first. Then, the difference between the entropies of the prediction discrepancies is defined to measure the image quality. Experimental results on four large-scale image databases confirm the effectiveness of the FSI and its superiority over representative image quality assessment methods. The FSI belongs to reduced-reference methods, and it only needs a single number from the reference image for quality estimation.",

      "abstract": "Recognizing and aligning individuals’ unique adaptive beliefs or “priors” through cooperative communication is critical to establishing a therapeutic relationship and alliance. Using active inference, we present an empirical integrative account of the biobehavioral mechanisms that underwrite therapeutic relationships. A significant mode of establishing cooperative alliances—and potential synchrony relationships—is through ostensive cues generated by repetitive coupling during dynamic touch. Established models speak to the unique role of affectionate touch in developing communication, interpersonal interactions, and a wide variety of therapeutic benefits for patients of all ages; both neurophysiologically and behaviorally. The purpose of this article is to argue for the importance of therapeutic touch in establishing a therapeutic alliance and, ultimately, synchrony between practitioner and patient. We briefly overview the importance and role of therapeutic alliance in prosocial and clinical interactions. We then discuss how cooperative communication and mental state alignment—in intentional communication—are accomplished using active inference. We argue that alignment through active inference facilitates synchrony and communication. The ensuing account is extended to include the role of (C-) tactile afferents in realizing the beneficial effect of therapeutic synchrony. We conclude by proposing a method for synchronizing the effects of touch using the concept of active inference.",

      "abstract": "Neural complexity and brain entropy (BEN) have gained greater interest in recent years. The dynamics of neural signals and their relations with information processing continue to be investigated through different measures in a variety of noteworthy studies. The BEN of spontaneous neural activity decreases during states of reduced consciousness. This evidence has been showed in primary consciousness states, such as psychedelic states, under the name of “the entropic brain hypothesis.” In this manuscript we propose an extension of this hypothesis to physiological and pathological aging. We review this particular facet of the complexity of the brain, mentioning studies that have investigated BEN in primary consciousness states, and extending this view to the field of neuroaging with a focus on resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We first introduce historic and conceptual ideas about entropy and neural complexity, treating the mindbrain as a complex nonlinear dynamic adaptive system, in light of the free energy principle. Then, we review the studies in this field, analyzing the idea that the aim of the neurocognitive system is to maintain a dynamic state of balance between order and chaos, both in terms of dynamics of neural signals and functional connectivity. In our exploration we will review studies both on acute psychedelic states and more chronic psychotic states and traits, such as those in schizophrenia, in order to show the increase of entropy in those states. Then we extend our exploration to physiological and pathological aging, where BEN is reduced. Finally, we propose an interpretation of these results, defining a general trend of BEN in primary states and cognitive aging.",

      "abstract": "While the ubiquity and importance of narratives for human adaptation is widely recognized, there is no integrative framework for understanding the roles of narrative in human adaptation. Research has identified several cognitive and social functions of narratives that are conducive to well-being and adaptation as well as to coordinated social practices and enculturation. In this paper, we characterize the cognitive and social functions of narratives in terms of active inference, to support the claim that one of the main adaptive functions of narrative is to generate more useful (i.e., accurate, parsimonious) predictions for the individual, as well as to coordinate group action (over multiple timescales) through shared predictions about collective behavior. Active inference is a theory that depicts the fundamental tendency of living organisms to adapt by proactively inferring the causes of their sensations (including their own actions). We review narrative research on identity, event segmentation, episodic memory, future projections, storytelling practices, enculturation, and master narratives. We show how this research dovetails with the active inference framework and propose an account of the cognitive and social functions of narrative that emphasizes that narratives are for the future—even when they are focused on recollecting or recounting the past. Understanding narratives as cognitive and cultural tools for mutual prediction in social contexts can guide research on narrative in adaptive behavior and psychopathology, based on a parsimonious mechanistic model of some of the basic adaptive functions of narrative.",

      "abstract": "Optimal performance in time-constrained and dynamically changing environments depends on making reliable predictions about future outcomes. In sporting tasks, performers have been found to employ multiple information sources to maximise the accuracy of their predictions, but questions remain about how different information sources are weighted and integrated to guide anticipation. In this paper, we outline how predictive processing approaches, and active inference in particular, provide a unifying account of perception and action that explains many of the prominent findings in the sports anticipation literature. Active inference proposes that perception and action are underpinned by the organism’s need to remain within certain stable states. To this end, decision making approximates Bayesian inference and actions are used to minimise future prediction errors during brain–body–environment interactions. Using a series of Bayesian neurocomputational models based on a partially observable Markov process, we demonstrate that key findings from the literature can be recreated from the first principles of active inference. In doing so, we formulate a number of novel and empirically falsifiable hypotheses about human anticipation capabilities that could guide future investigations in the field.",

In recent years, this framework has been applied successfully to a variety of situations where the goal was to maximize reward, often offering comparable and sometimes superior performance to alternative approaches. In this article, we clarify the connection between reward maximization and active inference by demonstrating how and when active inference agents execute actions that are optimal for maximizing reward. Precisely, we show the conditions under which active inference produces the optimal solution to the Bellman equation, a formulation that underlies several approaches to model-based reinforcement learning and control. On partially observed Markov decision processes, the standard active inference scheme can produce Bellman optimal actions for planning horizons of 1 but not beyond. In contrast, a recently developed recursive active inference scheme (sophisticated inference) can produce Bellman optimal actions on any finite temporal horizon. We append the analysis with a discussion of the broader relationship between active inference and reinforcement learning.",

One fundamental yet underexplored aspect of brain and body interactions is the link between the respiratory and the nervous systems. In this article, we give an overview of the emerging literature on how respiration modulates neural, cognitive and emotional processes. Moreover, we present a perspective linking respiration to the free-energy principle. We frame volitional modulation of the breath as an active inference mechanism in which sensory evidence is recontextualized to alter interoceptive models. We further propose that respiration-entrained gamma oscillations may reflect the propagation of prediction errors from the sensory level up to cortical regions in order to alter higher level predictions. Accordingly, controlled breathing emerges as an easily accessible tool for emotional, cognitive, and physiological regulation.",

      "abstract": "We offer a formal treatment of choice behavior based on the premise that agents minimize the expected free energy of future outcomes. Crucially, the negative free energy or quality of a policy can be decomposed into extrinsic and epistemic (or intrinsic) value. Minimizing expected free energy is therefore equivalent to maximizing extrinsic value or expected utility (defined in terms of prior preferences or goals), while maximizing information gain or intrinsic value (or reducing uncertainty about the causes of valuable outcomes). The resulting scheme resolves the exploration-exploitation dilemma: Epistemic value is maximized until there is no further information gain, after which exploitation is assured through maximization of extrinsic value. This is formally consistent with the Infomax principle, generalizing formulations of active vision based upon salience (Bayesian surprise) and optimal decisions based on expected utility and risk-sensitive (Kullback-Leibler) control. Furthermore, as with previous active inference formulations of discrete (Markovian) problems, ad hoc softmax parameters become the expected (Bayes-optimal) precision of beliefs about, or confidence in, policies. This article focuses on the basic theory, illustrating the ideas with simulations. A key aspect of these simulations is the similarity between precision updates and dopaminergic discharges observed in conditioning paradigms.",

      "abstract": "The spread of ideas is a fundamental concern of today’s news ecology. Understanding the dynamics of the spread of information and its co-option by interested parties is of critical importance. Research on this topic has shown that individuals tend to cluster in echo-chambers and are driven by confirmation bias. In this paper, we leverage the active inference framework to provide an in silico model of confirmation bias and its effect on echo-chamber formation. We build a model based on active inference, where agents tend to sample information in order to justify their own view of reality, which eventually leads to them to have a high degree of certainty about their own beliefs. We show that, once agents have reached a certain level of certainty about their beliefs, it becomes very difficult to get them to change their views. This system of self-confirming beliefs is upheld and reinforced by the evolving relationship between an agent’s beliefs and observations, which over time will continue to provide evidence for their ingrained ideas about the world. The epistemic communities that are consolidated by these shared beliefs, in turn, tend to produce perceptions of reality that reinforce those shared beliefs. We provide an active inference account of this community formation mechanism. We postulate that agents are driven by the epistemic value that they obtain from sampling or observing the behaviours of other agents. Inspired by digital social networks like Twitter, we build a generative model in which agents generate observable social claims or posts (e.g., ‘tweets’) while reading the socially observable claims of other agents that lend support to one of two mutually exclusive abstract topics. Agents can choose which other agent they pay attention to at each timestep, and crucially who they attend to and what they choose to read influences their beliefs about the world. Agents also assess their local network’s perspective, influencing which kinds of posts they expect to see other agents making. The model was built and simulated using the freely available Python package pymdp. The proposed active inference model can reproduce the formation of echo-chambers over social networks, and gives us insight into the cognitive processes that lead to this phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "Social neuroscience has often been criticized for approaching the investigation of the neural processes that enable social interaction and cognition from a passive, detached, third-person perspective, without involving any real-time social interaction. With the emergence of second-person neuroscience, investigators have uncovered the unique complexity of neural-activation patterns in actual, real-time interaction. Social cognition that occurs during social interaction is fundamentally different from that unfolding during social observation. However, it remains unclear how the neural correlates of social interaction are to be interpreted. Here, we leverage the active-inference framework to shed light on the mechanisms at play during social interaction in second-person neuroscience studies. Specifically, we show how counterfactually rich mutual predictions, real-time bodily adaptation, and policy selection explain activation in components of the default mode, salience, and frontoparietal networks of the brain, as well as in the basal ganglia. We further argue that these processes constitute the crucial neural processes that underwrite bona fide social interaction. By placing the experimental approach of second-person neuroscience on the theoretical foundation of the active-inference framework, we inform the field of social neuroscience about the mechanisms of real-life interactions. We thereby contribute to the theoretical foundations of empirical second-person neuroscience.",

Here, we discuss a proof-of-principle implementation of the active inference scheme for the control or the 7-DoF arm of a (simulated) PR2 robot. By manipulating visual and proprioceptive noise levels, we show under which conditions robot control under the active inference scheme is accurate. Besides accurate control, our analysis of the internal system dynamics (e.g. the dynamics of the hidden states that are inferred during the inference) sheds light on key aspects of the framework such as the quintessentially multimodal nature of control and the differential roles of proprioception and vision. In the discussion, we consider the potential importance of being able to implement active inference in robots. In particular, we briefly review the opportunities for modelling psychophysiological phenomena such as sensory attenuation and related failures of gain control, of the sort seen in Parkinson's disease. We also consider the fundamental difference between active inference and optimal control formulations, showing that in the former the heavy lifting shifts from solving a dynamical inverse problem to creating deep forward or generative models with dynamics, whose attracting sets prescribe desired behaviours.",

In this paper, we propose an active inference account of self-esteem, casting it as a sociometer or an inferential capacity to interpret one’s standing within a social group. This approach allows us to explore the interaction between an individual’s self-perception and the expectations of their social environment.When there is a mismatch between these perceptions and expectations, the individual needs to adjust their actions or update their self-perception to better align with their current experiences. We also consider this hypothesis in relation with recent research on affective inference, suggesting that self-esteem enables the individual to track and respond to this discrepancy through affective states such as anxiety or positive affect. By acting as an inferential sociometer, self-esteem allows individuals to navigate and adapt to their social environment, ultimately impacting their psychological well-being and mental health.",

      "abstract": "This theoretical paper explores the affect-logic approach to schizophrenia in light of the general complexity theories of cognition: embodied cognition, Haken’s synergetics, and Friston’s free energy principle. According to affect-logic, the mental apparatus is an embodied system open to its environment, driven by bioenergetic inputs of emotions. Emotions are rooted in goal-directed embodied states selected by evolutionary pressure for coping with specific situations such as fight, flight, attachment, and others. According to synergetics, nonlinear bifurcations and the emergence of new global patterns occur in open systems when control parameters reach a critical level. Applied to the emergence of psychotic states, synergetics and the proposed energetic understanding of emotions lead to the hypothesis that critical levels of emotional tension may be responsible for the transition from normal to psychotic modes of functioning in vulnerable individuals. In addition, the free energy principle through learning suggests that psychotic symptoms correspond to alternative modes of minimizing free energy, which then entails distorted perceptions of the body, self, and reality. This synthetic formulation has implications for novel therapeutic and preventive strategies in the treatment of psychoses, among these are milieu-therapeutic approaches of the Soteria type that focus on a sustained reduction of emotional tension and phenomenologically oriented methods for improving the perception of body, self, and reality.",

In this hypothesis and theory paper, we present an entwined model that combines touch for alignment and active inference to explain how the brain develops “priors” necessary for the health care provider to engage with the patient effectively. We appeal to active inference to explain the empirically integrative neurophysiological and behavioural mechanisms that underwrite synchronous relationships through touch. Specifically, we offer a formal framework for understanding – and explaining – the role of therapeutic touch and hands-on care in developing a therapeutic alliance and synchrony between health care providers and their patients in musculoskeletal care. We first review the crucial importance of therapeutic touch and its clinical role in facilitating the formation of a solid therapeutic alliance and in regulating allostasis. We then consider how touch is used clinically – to promote cooperative communication, demonstrate empathy, overcome uncertainty, and infer the mental states of others – through the lens of active inference. We conclude that touch plays a crucial role in achieving successful clinical outcomes and adapting previous priors to create intertwined beliefs. The ensuing framework may help healthcare providers in the field of musculoskeletal care to use hands-on care to strengthen the therapeutic alliance, minimise prediction errors (a.k.a., free energy), and thereby promote recovery from physical and psychological impairments.",

      "abstract": "How to account for the power that art holds over us? Why do artworks touch us deeply, consoling, transforming or invigorating us in the process? In this paper, we argue that an answer to this question might emerge from a fecund framework in cognitive science known as predictive processing (a.k.a. active inference). We unpack how this approach connects sense-making and aesthetic experiences through the idea of an ‘epistemic arc’, consisting of three parts (curiosity, epistemic action and aha experiences), which we cast as aspects of active inference. We then show how epistemic arcs are built and sustained by artworks to provide us with those satisfying experiences that we tend to call ‘aesthetic’. Next, we defuse two key objections to this approach; namely, that it places undue emphasis on the cognitive component of our aesthetic encounters—at the expense of affective aspects—and on closure and uncertainty minimization (order)—at the expense of openness and lingering uncertainty (change). We show that the approach offers crucial resources to account for the open-ended, free and playful behaviour inherent in aesthetic experiences. The upshot is a promising but deflationary approach, both philosophically informed and psychologically sound, that opens new empirical avenues for understanding our aesthetic encounters. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Art, aesthetics and predictive processing: theoretical and empirical perspectives’.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS\nActive inference has become an influential concept in psychopathology. We apply active inference to investigate conceptual disorganization in first-episode schizophrenia. We conceptualize speech production as a decision-making process affected by the latent \"conceptual organization\"-as a special case of uncertainty about the causes of sensory information. Uncertainty is both minimized via speech production-in which function words index conceptual organization in terms of analytic thinking-and tracked by a domain-general salience network. We hypothesize that analytic thinking depends on conceptual organization. Therefore, conceptual disorganization in schizophrenia would be both indexed by low conceptual organization and reflected in the effective connectivity within the salience network.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nWith 1-minute speech samples from a picture description task and resting state fMRI from 30 patients and 30 healthy subjects, we employed dynamic causal and probabilistic graphical models to investigate if the effective connectivity of the salience network underwrites conceptual organization.\n\n\nSTUDY RESULTS\nLow analytic thinking scores index low conceptual organization which affects diagnostic status. The influence of the anterior insula on the anterior cingulate cortex and the self-inhibition within the anterior cingulate cortex are elevated given low conceptual organization (ie, conceptual disorganization).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nConceptual organization, a construct that explains formal thought disorder, can be modeled in an active inference framework and studied in relation to putative neural substrates of disrupted language in schizophrenia. This provides a critical advance to move away from rating-scale scores to deeper constructs in the pursuit of the pathophysiology of formal thought disorder.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we unite concepts from Husserlian phenomenology, the active inference framework in theoretical biology, and category theory in mathematics to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding social action premised on shared goals. We begin with an overview of Husserlian phenomenology, focusing on aspects of inner time-consciousness, namely, retention, primal impression, and protention. We then review active inference as a formal approach to modeling agent behavior based on variational (approximate Bayesian) inference. Expanding upon Husserl’s model of time consciousness, we consider collective goal-directed behavior, emphasizing shared protentions among agents and their connection to the shared generative models of active inference. This integrated framework aims to formalize shared goals in terms of shared protentions, and thereby shed light on the emergence of group intentionality. Building on this foundation, we incorporate mathematical tools from category theory, in particular, sheaf and topos theory, to furnish a mathematical image of individual and group interactions within a stochastic environment. Specifically, we employ morphisms between polynomial representations of individual agent models, allowing predictions not only of their own behaviors but also those of other agents and environmental responses. Sheaf and topos theory facilitates the construction of coherent agent worldviews and provides a way of representing consensus or shared understanding. We explore the emergence of shared protentions, bridging the phenomenology of temporal structure, multi-agent active inference systems, and category theory. Shared protentions are highlighted as pivotal for coordination and achieving common objectives. We conclude by acknowledging the intricacies stemming from stochastic systems and uncertainties in realizing shared goals.",

      "abstract": "Biological agents can act in ways that express a sensitivity to context-dependent relevance. So far it has proven difficult to engineer this capacity for context-dependent sensitivity to relevance in artificial agents. We give this problem the label the “problem of meaning”. The problem of meaning could be circumvented if artificial intelligence researchers were to design agents based on the assumption of the continuity of life and mind. In this paper, we focus on the proposal made by enactive cognitive scientists to design artificial agents that possess sensorimotor autonomy—stable, self-sustaining patterns of sensorimotor interaction that can ground values, norms and goals necessary for encountering a meaningful environment. More specifically, we consider whether the Free Energy Principle (FEP) can provide formal tools for modeling sensorimotor autonomy. There is currently no consensus on how to understand the relationship between enactive cognitive science and the FEP. However, a number of recent papers have argued that the two frameworks are fundamentally incompatible. Some argue that biological systems exhibit historical path-dependent learning that is absent from systems that minimize free energy. Others have argued that a free energy minimizing system would fail to satisfy a key condition for sensorimotor agency referred to as “interactional asymmetry”. These critics question the claim we defend in this paper that the FEP can be used to formally model autonomy and adaptivity. We will argue it is too soon to conclude that the two frameworks are incompatible. There are undeniable conceptual differences between the two frameworks but in our view each has something important and necessary to offer. The FEP needs enactive cognitive science for the solution it provides to the problem of meaning. Enactive cognitive science needs the FEP to formally model the properties it argues to be constitutive of agency. Our conclusion will be that active inference models based on the FEP provides a way by which scientists can think about how to address the problems of engineering autonomy and adaptivity in artificial agents in formal terms. In the end engaging more closely with this formalism and its further developments will benefit those working within the enactive framework.",

Despite being experienced as a continuous flow, computational models of consciousness are typically restricted to a sequential temporal structure. This difference poses a serious challenge for computational phenomenology—a novel field combining phenomenology and computational modelling. By analysing the temporal structure of the active inference framework, we show that an integrated continuity of time can be achieved by merging Husserlian temporality with a sequential order of time. We also show that a Markov blanket of the present moment integrates past and future moments of both subjective temporality and objective time in an asynchronous manner. By applying the integrated continuity, it is clear that active inference makes use of both subjective temporality and objective time in an integrated fashion. We conclude that active inference, on a temporal note, qualifies as a computational model for phenomenological investigations.",

It provides a conceptual overview of the free energy principle; including Markov blankets, active inference, and-in particular-a discussion of selfhood and theory of mind, followed by a brief explanation of how these concepts can explain both neural and cultural models of emotional inference. The underlying hypothesis is that emotion recognition and inference devices will evolve from state-of-the-art deep learning models into active inference schemes that go beyond marketing applications and become adjunct to psychiatric practice. Specifically, this paper proposes that a second wave of emotion recognition devices will be equipped with an emotional lexicon (or the ability to epistemically search for one), allowing the device to resolve uncertainty about emotional states by actively eliciting responses from the user and learning from these responses. Following this, a third wave of emotional devices will converge upon the user's generative model, resulting in the machine and human engaging in a reciprocal, prosocial emotional interaction, i.e., sharing a generative model of emotional states.",

      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder is among the world’s most prevalent psychiatric disorders and often manifests as persistent and difficult to control apprehension. Despite its prevalence, there is no integrative, formal model of how anxiety and anxiety disorders arise. Here, we offer a perspective derived from the free energy principle; one that shares similarities with established constructs such as learned helplessness. Our account is simple: anxiety can be formalized as learned uncertainty. A biological system, having had persistent uncertainty in its past, will expect uncertainty in its future, irrespective of whether uncertainty truly persists. Despite our account’s intuitive simplicity—which can be illustrated with the mere flip of a coin—it is grounded within the free energy principle and hence situates the formation of anxiety within a broader explanatory framework of biological self-organization and self-evidencing. We conclude that, through conceptualizing anxiety within a framework of working generative models, our perspective might afford novel approaches in the clinical treatment of anxiety and its key symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Living systems face both environmental complexity and limited access to free-energy resources. Survival under these conditions requires a control system that can activate, or deploy, available perception and action resources in a context specific way. In this Part I, we introduce the free-energy principle (FEP) and the idea of active inference as Bayesian prediction-error minimization, and show how the control problem arises in active inference systems. We then review classical and quantum formulations of the FEP, with the former being the classical limit of the latter. In the accompanying Part II, we show that when systems are described as executing active inference driven by the FEP, their control flow systems can always be represented as tensor networks (TNs). We show how TNs as control systems can be implemented within the general framework of quantum topological neural networks, and discuss the implications of these results for modeling biological systems at multiple scales.",

      "abstract": "Active inference, a first-principles framework for modelling the behaviour of sentient agents, is beginning to be applied in consciousness research. One hypothesis arising from the framework is that active inference is necessary for changes in conscious content. As one component of an extensive adversarial collaboration among competing theories of consciousness, active inference will be contrasted with two other theories of consciousness, neither of which posit that active inference is necessary for consciousness. Here, we thus present a Study Protocol designed to test the active inference hypothesis using a carefully controlled adaptation of the motion-induced blindness paradigm, where an 'active' condition with richer active inference is contrasted with a 'passive' condition. In the active condition, participants direct their gaze towards a target stimulus following its disappearance from consciousness, and report on its subsequent reappearance. In the passive condition, participants maintain central fixation, while the stimulus array is moved across the visual field (in a replay of the active condition based on eye-tracking data acquired during active trials). In two experiments, we plan to investigate target reappearance across active and passive conditions to evaluate the contribution of active inference to conscious awareness. Results will eventually be considered in the context of all the experiments conducted as part of the overall adversarial collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a general framework for optimizing the behavior and learning of a sentient agential system. It may be interpreted as a general theory of sentient behavior and has been used to quantitatively model a wide variety of perceptual and behavioral contexts. Moreover, variables in neural process models of active inference appear to be represented by specific pathways in the brain, and they predict some features of actual neural responses and behavioral patterns in a variety of contexts. These applications support the validity of the active inference framework for describing real animals. However, implementing active inference in a conscious agent requires a system capable of sophisticated probabilistic computations, including a weighted average over its potential future trajectories-a path integral. Although it is straightforward to construct realistic classical biophysical neural models to approximate these computations in simple contexts, we argue in this first of two companion papers that classical Hodgkin-Huxley-style neurons are unlikely to be capable of performing these computations ",

We further explained that conscious (temporally deep) active inference is mathematically equivalent to the path integral that underlies quantum dynamics. As such, we proposed that a quantum model provides a natural, biologically plausible mechanistic implementation of the processing required by active inference. In this second paper we review the evidence establishing discrete non-overlapping cycles of perceptual inference, and argue that classical process models have so far failed to motivate or describe these discrete cycles in terms of realistic neural mechanisms. We then point out that the Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR) theory of consciousness naturally solves this fundamental problem. Along the way, we review independent strong theoretical and experimental evidence from my (Wiest) lab and others' supporting the Orch OR quantum theory of consciousness as a collective quantum property of intraneuronal microtubules (MTs). This includes demonstration of room-temperature quantum effects in MTs, MT resonances controlling membrane spiking in living neurons, evidence that volatile anesthetics target MTs to cause unconsciousness, and direct biophysical evidence of a macroscopic entangled state in the living human brain. Intraneuronal MTs thus offer a biologically specific and experimentally supported substrate for implementing conscious active inference in brains.",

By de novo learning, we mean discovering, directly from observations, the structure and parameters of a discrete generative model for sequential policy optimisation. Concretely, our procedure grows and then reduces a model until it discovers a pullback attractor over (generalised) states; this attracting set supplies paths of least action among goal states while avoiding costly states. The implicit efficiency rests upon reframing the learning problem through the lens of the free energy principle, under which it is sufficient to learn a generative model whose dynamics feature such an attracting set. For context, we briefly relate this perspective to value-based formulations (e.g., Bellman optimality) and then apply the active inference formulation to a small arcade game to illustrate de novo structure learning and ensuing agency.",

Psychosocial and biological perspectives are often placed in opposition to one another, which in part reflects a failure of our explanatory frameworks. The active inference account of brain function breaks down this dualism, demonstrating that bodily processes are deeply integrated with the social world. It shows us that there is no contradiction in understanding depression as a product of the social environment at the same time as having a brain basis and manifesting in biological symptoms. From an active inference perspective, depression can be thought of as a synaptopathy: a disorder that arises from alterations to the excitatory-inhibitory balance enacted at the synapse, reflecting the interoceptive precision-weightings that have changed in the context of psychosocial instability. Therapies that alleviate depressive symptoms act at different levels of the active inference framework to re-weight precision estimates and the confidence we have in our predictions: this is true for psychotherapies, lifestyle interventions and antidepressant medications. Their effectiveness is often only partial, and while different treatment modalities can complement one another, there is a need for continued development of new and better treatment options.",

This framework combines a first-principles-based perspective with nonlinear dynamical systems, clinical, and neurobiological perspectives. We propose that a substantial change in the parameter we call \"temporal depth\" can be a common factor in dissociative episodes of any etiology, moreover, we consider such a change to have causal power.

In parallel, current models of chronic pain describe how fear and negative beliefs about pain lead to avoidance of painful sensations and a threatened response to their occurrence, entrenching a cycle of amplified pain that risks becoming chronic. These models are informed by theories of active inference, which describe how the brain actively shapes sensory experience to reduce prediction errors (discrepancy between predictions and sensory data).

If there is a bodily problem an error signal is generated and the brain then attempts to infer a cause or explanation for the distortions in the bodily image. It is this picture or updated model of the body (which attempts to depict or explain the distortions or errors in bodily senses) which I suggest then gets depicted in dreams. Prediction error can be remedied either via active inference leading to corrective action, or by model updating-generating models that explain away the error. I suggest that the depiction of the cause of the predictive error (bodily distortions) emerges in dreams (typically with picture language or metaphor) and thus can be interpreted to help diagnose emerging illnesses. The active inference portion of the model updating process on the other hand will depict potential solutions to the predictive error and if this information emerges in dreams these dreams might plausibly contain information to ameliorate/treat the causes of the bodily distortions.",

      "abstract": "Since the early experimental studies of the late 19th century, research on unconscious perception has been shaped by persistent methodological challenges and evolving experimental approaches aimed at demonstrating perception without awareness. In this review, we will discuss some of the most relevant challenges researchers have faced in demonstrating unconscious perception, and examine how different measures of awareness (e.g., objective vs. subjective) yield different awareness thresholds-often leading to two alternative approaches to demonstrating unconscious perception. We will further explore new methodologies in the field, such as regression-based Bayesian modeling, sensitivity vs. awareness (SvA) curves derived from General Recognition Theory (GRT), the liminal-prime paradigm, and two-interval forced choice (2IFC) designs. Finally, we emphasize the need for brain-based approaches to unconscious perception and discussed some promising studies in this area, while also highlighting the role of individual differences and alternative frameworks such as predictive coding and active inference views in future research. Overall, the new approaches and methodologies discussed here will advance the field by addressing the challenges inherent in demonstrating cognition in the absence of awareness.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, the free energy principle (FEP) and active inference (AIF) have achieved many successes connecting conceptual models of learning and cognition to mathematical models of perception and action. This effort is driven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of self-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various reinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been proposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent work has focused on improving such agents' performance in complex environments by incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we build upon these techniques. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we attempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by introducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards only, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable environments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a given task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free energy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced to deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous hidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired from behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid. Our results show that FEPS agents fully resolve the ambiguity of both environments by appropriately contextualizing their observations based on prediction accuracy only. In addition, they infer optimal policies flexibly for any target observation in the environment.",

      "abstract": "Active inference offers a unified framework in which agents can exhibit both goal-directed and epistemic behaviors. However, implementing policy search in high-dimensional continuous action spaces presents challenges in terms of scalability and stability. Our previously proposed model, T-GLean, addressed this issue by enabling efficient goal-directed planning through low-dimensional latent space search, further reduced by conditioning on prior habituated behavior. However, the lack of an epistemic term in minimizing expected free energy limited the agent's ability to engage in information-seeking behavior that can be critical for attaining preferred outcomes. In this study, we present EFE-GLean, an extended version of T-GLean that overcomes this limitation by integrating epistemic value into the planning process. EFE-GLean generates goal-directed policies by inferring low-dimensional future posterior trajectories while maximizing expected information gain. Simulation experiments using an extended T-maze task-implemented in both discrete and continuous domains-demonstrate that the agent can successfully achieve its goals by exploiting hidden environmental information. Furthermore, we show that the agent is capable of adapting to abrupt environmental changes by dynamically revising plans through simultaneous minimization of past variational free energy and future expected free energy.

Adaptive behaviors necessarily depend not only on the successful integration of multisensory bodily signals but also on how we move our bodies in the world. This paper considers the notion of embodied selfhood through the perspective of dynamic and rhymical coupling between bodily movements and bodily actions. We propose a new theoretical framework suggesting that the dynamic coupling between bodily movements and bodily actions in the world are fundamental in constructing and maintaining a coherent sense of self. To support this idea, we use the Predictive Processing (PP) and Active Inference frameworks as our background theoretical canvas. Specifically, we will focus on the phenomenon of somatosensory attenuation in relation to dynamic selfhood and argue that rhythmic bodily signals such as heartbeats, breathing, and walking patterns are predictable and, thus, can be smoothly attenuated, i.e., processed in the background. We illustrate this hypothesis by discussing the case of Depersonalization Disorder as a failure to self-attenuate self-related information processing, leading to feelings of unreality and self 'loss'. We conclude with potential implications of our hypothesis for therapy.",

      "abstract": "The context for our paper comes from the neurophenomenology (NPh) research programme initiated by Francisco Varela at the end of the 1990s. Varela's working hypothesis was that, to be successful, a consciousness research programme must progress by relating first-person phenomenological accounts of the structure of experience and their third-person counterparts in neuroscience through \"mutual constraints\". Leveraging Bayesian mechanics, in particular deep parametric active inference, we demonstrate the potential for epistemically advantageous mutual constraints between phenomenological, computational, behavioural, and physiological vocabularies. Specifically, the dual information geometry of Bayesian mechanics serves to establish, under certain conditions, generative passage between lived experience and its physiological instantiation. This paper argues for the epistemological necessity of such a passage and the inclusion of trained reflective awareness in neurophenomenological empirical approaches. In particular, it showcases incremental explanatory gains for the scientist that arise from incorporating the participants' epistemic insights, shifting the focus from the contents of experience (i.e. what a subject experiences in a given experimental set-up) to the how of experience (i.e. the activities of consciousness that allow for a meaningful world to appear to us as such in lived experience). The explanatory power of the resulting 'meta-Bayesian' framework, deep computational NPh, arises from the disciplined circulation between first and third-person perspectives enabled by the formalism of deep parametric active inference, where parametric depth refers to a property of generative models that can form beliefs about the parameters of their own modelling process. Hence, this computational formalism contributes to understanding consciousness by bridging phenomenological descriptions and physiological instantiations, whilst also highlighting the significance of trained first-person investigation in experimental protocols.",

      "abstract": "The active inference framework (AIF) considers the brain as a generative model guiding behavior under the imperative of minimizing the model's variational free energy. Computationally, this is accomplished by hierarchical Bayesian inference. The theory views organisms as doxastic agents, which has drawn the criticism of being insufficient to explain conative agents motivated by desire. Specifically, it has been noted that the concept of desire is not isomorphic with belief and, therefore, fits poorly with AIF. In this paper, we build on previous work that suggests a path to integrating conation in AIF and present three arguments. First, the dichotomy between belief and desire is unnecessary. To that end, we define desire as a hierarchical inference that starts from a domain-general inference on the agent's affective dynamics (affective charge) and descends to contextualized inference on the precision of action policies. We suggest that this hierarchy is implemented by a coordinated activity of the intrinsic brain networks: default mode, action mode, executive, and salient. Second, we argue for a central role that deferred action plays in the process of desire by allowing for affect-dependent awareness of the agent's states over different timescales. Third, we suggest that the proposed model of desire and deferred action has ramifications for understanding psychopathology, which we frame as the malfunction of deferred action and desire and use obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression as examples. This view entails that disorders of affect and motivation are subjectively desired despite their associated suffering.",

The urge to move (groove) induced by syncopation, which provides metric uncertainty, can be considered a case of active inference in music perception. The present study investigated whether rhythmic prediction error is modulated by improving the precision of rhythm perception through tapping in sync with the rhythm. Thirty-five participants listened to a rhythmic sequence while tapping the half-note beat (tapping condition) or holding a pillow (no-tapping condition), and electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. In both conditions, the onset of the syncopated tone was rarely earlier (timing deviant: 20%) than the standard (80%). The timing deviant elicited mismatch negativity (MMN) in both the tapping and no-tapping conditions, reflecting a prediction error in timing. Moreover, the MMN was larger in the tapping condition than in the no-tapping condition, which may indicate increased precision due to tapping, even when motor-related potentials were controlled for. Neural entrainment was measured by calculating intertrial phase coherence (ITPC), which reflects oscillatory activity synchronized to stimulus frequency, and ITPC differed between the two conditions at beat-related frequencies. These results suggest that tapping enhanced meter and beat information and reduced the sensory surprisal of syncopation, resulting in a larger precision-weighted prediction error. These effects were not due to physiological arousal differences between conditions, as assessed by EEG power and heart rate variability. These results are discussed as evidence that bodily engagement modulates sensory prediction error within the active inference framework.",

      "abstract": "Studying psychiatric illness has often been limited by difficulties in connecting symptoms and behavior to neurobiology. Computational psychiatry approaches promise to bridge this gap by providing formal accounts of the latent information processing changes that underlie the development and maintenance of psychiatric phenomena. Models based on these theories generate individual-level parameter estimates which can then be tested for relationships to neurobiology. In this review, we explore computational modelling approaches to one key aspect of health and illness: affect. We discuss strengths and limitations of key approaches to modelling affect, with a focus on reinforcement learning, active inference, the hierarchical gaussian filter, and drift-diffusion models. We find that, in this literature, affect is an important source of modulation in decision making, and has a bidirectional influence on how individuals infer both internal and external states. Highlighting the potential role of affect in information processing changes underlying symptom development, we extend an existing model of psychosis, where affective changes are influenced by increasing cortical noise and consequent increases in either perceived environmental instability or expected noise in sensory input, becoming part of a self-reinforcing process generating negatively valenced, over-weighted priors underlying positive symptom development. We then provide testable predictions from this model at computational, neurobiological, and phenomenological levels of description.",

      "abstract": "Decision-making is often conceptualized as a serial process, during which sensory evidence is accumulated for the choice alternatives until a certain threshold is reached, at which point a decision is made and an action is executed. This decide-then-act perspective has successfully explained various facets of perceptual and economic decisions in the laboratory, in which action dynamics are usually irrelevant to the choice. However, living organisms often face another class of decisions-called embodied decisions-that require selecting between potential courses of actions to be executed timely in a dynamic environment, e.g., for a lion, deciding which gazelle to chase and how fast to do so. Studies of embodied decisions reveal two aspects of goal-directed behavior in stark contrast to the serial view. First, that decision and action processes can unfold in parallel; second, that action-related components, such as the motor costs associated with selecting a particular choice alternative or required to \"change mind\" between choice alternatives, exert a feedback effect on the decision taken. Here, we show that these signatures of embodied decisions emerge naturally in active inference-a framework that simultaneously optimizes perception and action, according to the same (free energy minimization) imperative. We show that optimizing embodied choices requires a continuous feedback loop between motor planning (where beliefs about choice alternatives guide action dynamics) and motor inference (where action dynamics finesse beliefs about choice alternatives). Furthermore, our active inference simulations reveal the normative character of embodied decisions in ecological settings - namely, achieving an effective balance between a high accuracy and a low risk of missing valid opportunities.",

As a consequence, synaptic connections become arranged in mirror-symmetric paired patterns, wherein exchanges of synaptic flux within each pattern form coupled spatial eigenmodes. The mirror-reflection axis between each pair functions as a Markov blanket that maintains excitatory-inhibitory equilibrium, while multiway exchanges among mirror pairs converge toward overall error minimization and mutual organization. The primary organization of this type is evident in the spinal cord. During cortical embryogenesis, connections develop in topographies interpretable as mirror reflections with broken symmetry, aligning along the radial and circumferential axes of cortical growth, as described by the Structural Model, and subsequently manifest at the millimetric scale throughout the cortex. The proposed framework integrates a diverse range of experimental data and provides an explanatory basis for how generative models with agency can emerge through both species evolution and individual learning.",

We begin by rehearsing the Free Energy Principle and Predictive Processing as foundational frameworks that subserve and inform the thesis that follows. The following sections examine three aspects of archetypes: the affective core rooted in subcortical systems, archetypal imagery emergent in altered states such as psychedelic experiences, and archetypal stories encoded in higher cortical areas. Specifically, we propose a trilogical interplay between the high-level cortex, the low-level cortex, and subcortical/affective systems in instantiating these archetypal phenomena. We then explore how archetypes may be transmitted between individuals, developing into a collective unconscious through social learning and subsequent attunement. Throughout, we provide syntheses of Jungian psychology with contemporary neuroscience, offering testable hypotheses regarding the neurological bases of archetypal phenomena. We conclude by discussing implications for both psychoanalytic theory and neuroscientific research. By bridging these disciplines, we aim to lend construct validity to Jungian concepts and encourage further empirical investigation of archetypes and the collective unconscious.",

While researchers generally agree that intuition represents \"an experienced-based process resulting in a spontaneous tendency toward a hunch or hypothesis,\" we establish a firmer neurobiological foundation by framing intuition evolutionarily as a pathfinding mechanism emerging from the brain's optimization of its relationship with the environment. Our review synthesizes empirical findings on intuition's neurobiological basis, including relevant brain networks and their relationship to cognitive states like insight. We propose that unsolved problems dynamically alter attractor landscapes, guiding future intuitions. We investigate \"opportunistic assimilation\" through nonlinear neurodynamics and identify hippocampal sharp wave ripples as potential neural correlates of intuition, citing their role in creativity, choice, action planning, and abstract thinking. Finally, we explore intuition through two complementary perspectives: the free energy principle, which models brains as minimizing uncertainty through predictive hierarchical coding, and metastable coordination dynamics, describing the brain's simultaneous tendencies toward regional cooperation and functional autonomy. Together, these principles provide a comprehensive neurodynamical account of intuition's neurophenomenology.",

To address this, we conduct model simulation experiments employing predictive coding as a theoretical framework of perception to investigate possible neural mechanisms underlying these autonomous shifts between the two states. In particular, we modeled perception processes of continuous sensory sequences using our previously proposed variational RNN model under free energy minimization.

The framework's remarkable flexibility in accommodating diverse findings raises concerns about its explanatory power, as models can often be adjusted post hoc to fit virtually any data pattern.

It is theorized that specific neurons encode the negative prediction error, distinct from those for the positive prediction error, and are linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, what information is actually encoded by omission responses remains unclear. This information is essential to confirm their role as negative prediction errors. Here, we record single-unit activity in the rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm where tone probabilities are manipulated to vary the prediction content. We identify neurons that robustly respond to omissions, with responses that increase with evidence accumulation and directly correlate with tone predictability-key characteristics suggesting their role as negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing an asymmetry in error signaling. To capture this asymmetry, we propose a circuit model composed of laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons that qualitatively reproduce the observed asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these lateral connections enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding across receptive fields, and that their validity is supported by the free energy principle.",

      "abstract": "Within a theoretical framework of enactive allostasis, we explore active inference strategies for minimizing surprise to achieve resilience in dynamic environments. While individual differences and extrinsic protective factors traditionally account for variability in resilience trajectories following stressor exposure, the enactive model emphasizes the importance of the physical and social environment, specifically the \"enactive niche,\" which is both shaped by and impacts organisms living in it, accounting for variable success in allostatic prediction and accommodation. Enactive allostasis infers or predicts states of the world to minimize surprise and maintain regulation after surprise, i.e., resilience. Action policies are selected in accordance with the inferred state of a dynamic environment; those actions concurrently shape one's environment, buffering against current and potential stressors. Through such inferential construction, multiple potential solutions exist for achieving stability within one's enactive niche. Spanning a range of adaptive resilience strategies, we propose four phenotypes-fragile, durable, resilient, and pro-entropic (PE)-each characterized by a constellation of genetic, epigenetic, developmental, experiential, and environmental factors. Biological regulatory outcomes range from allostatic (over)load in the fragile and durable phenotypes, to allostatic recovery in resilience, and theoretically to increasing allostatic accommodation or \"growth\" in the proposed PE phenotype. Awareness distinguishes phenotypes by minimizing allostatically demanding surprise and engenders the cognitive and behavioral flexibility empirically associated with resilience. We further propose a role for awareness in proactively shaping one's enactive niche to further minimize surprise. We conclude by exploring the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity which may bolster individual resilience.",

The problem of listening to speech in such environments must be solved by an auditory system that is not optimized for this task. Building on our previous work linking attention to effortful listening and incorporating an active inference approach, we argue that the answers to these questions have implications not just for the study of human audition.

When interpreted through the lens of the Conway-Kochen theorem and the Free Energy Principle, contemporary physics characterizes all complex dynamical systems that persist through time as Bayesian agents. If all persistent systems are to some - perhaps only minimal - extent cognitive, are all persistent systems to some extent alive, or are living systems only a subset of cognitive systems? We argue that no bright line can be drawn, and we re-assess, from this perspective, the Fermi paradox and the Drake equation. We conclude that improving our abilities to recognize and communicate with diverse intelligences in diverse embodiments, whether based on familiar biochemistry or not, will either resolve or obviate the OOL problem.",

      "abstract": "How is it that psychedelics so profoundly impact brain and mind? According to the model of \"Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics\" (REBUS), 5-HT2a agonism is thought to help relax prior expectations, thus making room for new perspectives and patterns. Here, we introduce an alternative (but largely compatible) perspective, proposing that REBUS effects may primarily correspond to a particular (but potentially pivotal) regime of very high levels of 5-HT2a receptor agonism. Depending on both a variety of contextual factors and the specific neural systems being considered, we suggest opposite effects may also occur in which synchronous neural activity becomes more powerful, with accompanying \"Strengthened Beliefs Under Psychedelics\" (SEBUS) effects. Such SEBUS effects are consistent with the enhanced meaning-making observed in psychedelic therapy (e.g. psychological insight and the noetic quality of mystical experiences), with the imposition of prior expectations on perception (e.g. hallucinations and pareidolia), and with the delusional thinking that sometimes occurs during psychedelic experiences (e.g. apophenia, paranoia, engendering of inaccurate interpretations of events, and potentially false memories). With \"Altered Beliefs Under Psychedelics\" (ALBUS), we propose that the manifestation of SEBUS vs. REBUS effects may vary across the dose-response curve of 5-HT2a signaling. While we explore a diverse range of sometimes complex models, our basic idea is fundamentally simple: psychedelic experiences can be understood as kinds of waking dream states of varying degrees of lucidity, with similar underlying mechanisms. We further demonstrate the utility of ALBUS by providing neurophenomenological models of psychedelics focusing on mechanisms of conscious perceptual synthesis, dreaming, and episodic memory and mental simulation.",

      "abstract": "This study explains how the leader-follower relationship and turn-taking could develop in a dyadic imitative interaction by conducting robotic simulation experiments based on the free energy principle. Our prior study showed that introducing a parameter during the model training phase can determine leader and follower roles for subsequent imitative interactions. The parameter is defined as w, the so-called meta-prior, and is a weighting factor used to regulate the complexity term versus the accuracy term when minimizing the free energy. This can be read as sensory attenuation, in which the robot’s prior beliefs about action are less sensitive to sensory evidence. The current extended study examines the possibility that the leader-follower relationship shifts depending on changes in w during the interaction phase. We identified a phase space structure with three distinct types of behavioral coordination using comprehensive simulation experiments with sweeps of w of both robots during the interaction. Ignoring behavior in which the robots follow their own intention was observed in the region in which both ws were set to large values. One robot leading, followed by the other robot was observed when one w was set larger and the other was set smaller. Spontaneous, random turn-taking between the leader and the follower was observed when both ws were set at smaller or intermediate values. Finally, we examined a case of slowly oscillating w in anti-phase between the two agents during the interaction. The simulation experiment resulted in turn-taking in which the leader-follower relationship switched during determined sequences, accompanied by periodic shifts of ws. An analysis using transfer entropy found that the direction of information flow between the two agents also shifted along with turn-taking. Herein, we discuss qualitative differences between random/spontaneous turn-taking and agreed-upon sequential turn-taking by reviewing both synthetic and empirical studies.",

This processing in turn emerges from continuous neuronal dynamics. Notable examples are sequences of words during linguistic communication or sequences of locations during navigation. In this perspective, we address the problem of sequential brain processing from the perspective of active inference, which inherits from a Helmholtzian view of the predictive (Bayesian) brain. Underneath the active inference lies a generative model; namely, a probabilistic description of how (observable) consequences are generated by (unobservable) causes. We show that one can account for many aspects of sequential brain processing by assuming the brain entails a generative model of the sensed world that comprises central pattern generators, narratives, or well-defined sequences. We provide examples in the domains of motor control (e.g., handwriting), perception (e.g., birdsong recognition) through to planning and understanding (e.g., language). The solutions to these problems include the use of sequences of attracting points to direct complex movements—and the move from continuous representations of auditory speech signals to the discrete words that generate those signals.",

      "abstract": "Although the increase in the use of dynamical modeling in the literature on cultural evolution makes current models more mathematically sophisticated, these models have yet to be tested or validated. This paper provides a testable deep active inference formulation of social behavior and accompanying simulations of cumulative culture in two steps: First, we cast cultural transmission as a bi-directional process of communication that induces a generalized synchrony (operationalized as a particular convergence) between the belief states of interlocutors. Second, we cast social or cultural exchange as a process of active inference by equipping agents with the choice of who to engage in communication with. This induces trade-offs between confirmation of current beliefs and exploration of the social environment. We find that cumulative culture emerges from belief updating (i.e., active inference and learning) in the form of a joint minimization of uncertainty. The emergent cultural equilibria are characterized by a segregation into groups, whose belief systems are actively sustained by selective, uncertainty minimizing, dyadic exchanges. The nature of these equilibria depends sensitively on the precision afforded by various probabilistic mappings in each individual's generative model of their encultured niche.",

Formulating a principle for the life sciences in terms of concepts from statistical physics, such as random dynamical system, non-equilibrium steady state and ergodicity, places substantial constraints on the theoretical and empirical study of biological systems. Thus far, however, the physics foundations of the free energy principle have received hardly any attention. Here, we start to fill this gap and analyse some of the challenges raised by applications of statistical physics for modelling biological targets. Based on our analysis, we conclude that model-building grounded in the free energy principle exacerbates a trade-off between generality and realism, because of a fundamental mismatch between its physics assumptions and the properties of actual biological targets.",

FEP characterizes life by living systems’ resistance to the second law of thermodynamics: living systems do not randomly visit the possible states, but actively work to remain within a set of viable states. In FEP, this is modelled mathematically. Yet, the status of these models is typically unclear: are these models employed by organisms or strictly scientific tools of understanding? In this article, I argue for an instrumentalist take on models in FEP. I shall argue that models used as instruments for knowledge by scientists and models as implemented by organisms to navigate the world are being conflated, which leads to erroneous conclusions. I further argue that a realist position is unwarranted. First, it overgenerates models and thus trivializes the notion of modelling. Second, even when the mathematical mechanisms described by FEP are implemented in an organism, they do not constitute a model. They are covariational, not representational in nature, and precede the social practices that have shaped our scientific modelling practice. I finally argue that the above arguments do not affect the instrumentalist position. An instrumentalist approach can further add to conceptual clarity in the FEP literature.",

In this paper, I suggest an extension of the monitor model to incorporate aspects of relevance theory (RT) and to adopt the free energy principle (FEP) as a generative model to elucidate translational behaviour. The FEP—and its corollary, active inference—provide a general, mathematical framework to explain how organisms resist entropic erosion so as to remain within their phenotypic bounds. It posits that organisms reduce the gap between their expectations and observations by minimising a quantity called free energy. I map these concepts on the translation process and exemplify them with behavioural data. The analysis is based on the notion of translation units (TUs) which exhibit observable traces of the translator’s epistemic and pragmatic engagement with their translation environment, (i.e., the text) that can be measured in terms of translation effort and effects. Sequences of TUs cluster into translation states (steady state, orientation, and hesitation). Drawing on active inference, sequences of translation states combine into translation policies that reduce expected free energy. I show how the notion of free energy is compatible with the concept of relevance, as developed in RT, and how essential concepts of the monitor model and RT can be formalised as deep temporal generative models that can be interpreted under a representationalist view, but also support a non-representationalist account.",

      "abstract": "This paper offers theoretical explanations for why “guided touch” or manual touch with verbal communication can be an effective way of treating the body (e.g., chronic pain) and the mind (e.g., emotional disorders). The active inference theory suggests that chronic pain and emotional disorders can be attributed to distorted and exaggerated patterns of interoceptive and proprioceptive inference. We propose that the nature of active inference is abductive. As such, to rectify aberrant active inference processes, we should change the “Rule” of abduction, or the “prior beliefs” entailed by a patient’s generative model. This means pre-existing generative models should be replaced with new models. To facilitate such replacement—or updating—the present treatment proposes that we should weaken prior beliefs, especially the one at the top level of hierarchical generative models, thereby altering the sense of agency, and redeploying attention. Then, a new prior belief can be installed through inner communication along with manual touch. The present paper proposes several hypotheses for possible experimental studies. If touch with verbal guidance is proven to be effective, this would demonstrate the relevance of active inference and the implicit prediction model at a behavioral level. Furthermore, it would open new possibilities of employing inner communication interventions, including self-talk training, for a wide range of psychological and physical therapies.",

      "abstract": "Drawing from field theory, Gestalt therapy conceives psychological suffering and psychotherapy as two intentional field phenomena, where unprocessed and chaotic experiences seek the opportunity to emerge and be assimilated through the contact between the patient and the therapist (i.e., the intentionality of contacting). This therapeutic approach is based on the therapist’s aesthetic experience of his/her embodied presence in the flow of the healing process because (1) the perception of beauty can provide the therapist with feedback on the assimilation of unprocessed experiences; (2) the therapist’s attentional focus on intrinsic aesthetic diagnostic criteria can facilitate the modification of rigid psychopathological fields by supporting the openness to novel experiences. The aim of the present manuscript is to review recent evidence from psychophysiology, neuroaesthetic research, and neurocomputational models of cognition, such as the free energy principle (FEP), which support the notion of the therapeutic potential of aesthetic sensibility in Gestalt psychotherapy. Drawing from neuroimaging data, psychophysiology and recent neurocognitive accounts of aesthetic perception, we propose a novel interpretation of the sense of beauty as a self-generated reward motivating us to assimilate an ever-greater spectrum of sensory and affective states in our predictive representation of ourselves and the world and supporting the intentionality of contact. Expecting beauty, in the psychotherapeutic encounter, can help therapists tolerate uncertainty avoiding impulsive behaviours and to stay tuned to the process of change.",

Early studies indicated that the brain might use blind source separation as a signal processing strategy for sensory perception and numerous mathematical models have been proposed; however, it remains unclear how the neural networks extract particular sources from a complex mixture of inputs. We discovered that neurons in cultures of dissociated rat cortical cells could learn to represent particular sources while filtering out other signals. Specifically, the distinct classes of neurons in the culture learned to respond to the distinct sources after repeating training stimulation. Moreover, the neural network structures changed to reduce free energy, as predicted by the free-energy principle, a candidate unified theory of learning and memory, and by Jaynes' principle of maximum entropy. This implicit learning can only be explained by some form of Hebbian plasticity. These results are the first in vitro (as opposed to in silico) demonstration of neural networks performing blind source separation, and the first formal demonstration of neuronal self-organization under the free energy principle.",

      "abstract": "Entropy management, central to the Free Energy Principle, requires a process that temporarily shifts brain activity toward states of lower or higher entropy. Metastable synchronization is a process by which a system achieves entropy fluctuations by intermittently transitioning between states of collective order and disorder. Previous work has shown that collective oscillations, similar to those recorded from the brain, emerge spontaneously from weakly stable synchronization in critically coupled oscillator systems. However, direct evidence linking the formation of collective oscillations to entropy fluctuations is lacking. In this short communication, we demonstrate how the emergence of Metastable Oscillatory Modes (MOMs) is directly associated with a temporary reduction in entropy in the ongoing dynamics. We apply Shannon entropy to the distribution of eigenvalues of phase covariance over sliding time windows, capturing the temporal evolution of entropy at the level of the entire dynamical system. By demonstrating how the formation of MOMs impacts a system's entropy levels, we bridge theoretical works on the physics of coupled oscillators with the FEP framework, supporting the hypothesis that brain rhythms recorded experimentally are a signature of entropy management.",

      "abstract": "After more than 30 years since its inception, the utility of brain imaging for understanding and diagnosing mental illnesses is in doubt, receiving well-grounded criticisms from clinical practitioners. Symptom-based correlational approaches have struggled to provide psychiatry with reliable brain-imaging metrics. However, the emergence of computational psychiatry has paved a new path not only for understanding the psychopathology of mental illness but also to provide practical tools for clinical practice in terms of computational metrics, specifically computational phenotypes. However, these phenotypes still lack sufficient test-retest reliability. In this review, we describe recent works revealing that mind and brain-related computational phenotypes show structural (not random) variation over time, longitudinal changes. Furthermore, we show that these findings suggest that understanding the causes of these changes will improve the construct validity of the phenotypes with an ensuing increase in test-retest reliability. We propose that the active inference framework offers a general-purpose approach for causally understanding these longitudinal changes by incorporating brain imaging as observations within partially observable Markov decision processes.",

The free-energy principle (FEP) advocated by Karl Friston explicates the local, recurrent, and self-supervised cognitive dynamics of the brain's higher-order functions. In this study, we continue to refine the FEP through a physics-guided formulation; specifically, we apply our theory to synaptic learning by considering it an inference problem under the FEP and derive the governing equations, called Bayesian mechanics. Our study uncovers how the brain infers weight changes and postsynaptic activity, conditioned on the presynaptic input, by deploying generative models of the likelihood and prior belief. Consequently, we exemplify the synaptic efficacy in the brain with a simple model; in particular, we illustrate that the brain organizes an optimal trajectory in neural phase space during synaptic learning in continuous time, which variationally minimizes synaptic surprisal.",

Computational neuropsychiatry offers potential breakthroughs through the mechanistic modeling of this disorder. Using the Kolmogorov theory (KT) of consciousness, we developed a foundational model where algorithmic agents interact with the world to maximize an Objective Function evaluating affective valence. Depression, defined in this context by a state of persistently low valence, may arise from various factors-including inaccurate world models (cognitive biases), a dysfunctional Objective Function (anhedonia, anxiety), deficient planning (executive deficits), or unfavorable environments. Integrating algorithmic, dynamical systems, and neurobiological concepts, we map the agent model to brain circuits and functional networks, framing potential etiological routes and linking with depression biotypes. Finally, we explore how brain stimulation, psychotherapy, and plasticity-enhancing compounds such as psychedelics can synergistically repair neural circuits and optimize therapies using personalized computational models.",

In this short review, we explore recent research findings regarding this frequently observed and replicated phenomenon - optimism bias - with particular attention on how this bias affects the way individuals update or revise their beliefs. We begin by highlighting five interrelated frameworks for understanding optimism bias (utility maximization, active inference, dual systems, cognitive immunity, predictive processing). We then examine findings from affective and clinical domains that indicate that people with depression and other psychiatric disorders, as well as acutely sad or anxious individuals, have dampened optimistic bias when updating beliefs in response to good news. Finally, we consider the neural underpinnings of these phenomena through the free energy principle and discuss implications for clinical interventions and future research.",

Evolution of a neural field with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity, maximizing synchrony and minimizing axonal length by apoptotic selection, leads to paired connection systems with mirror symmetry, interacting via Markov blankets along their line of reflection. Applied to development along the radial lines of development in the Structural Model, a primary Markov blanket emerges between the centrifugal synaptic flux in layers 2,3 and 5,6, versus the centripetal flow in layer 4, and axonal orientations in layer 4 give rise to the differing shape and movement sensitivities characteristic of neurons of dorsal and ventral neocortex. Prediction error minimization along the primary blanket integrates limbic and subcortical networks with the neocortex. Synaptic flux bypassing the blanket triggers the arousal response to surprising stimuli, enabling subsequent adaptation. As development progresses ubiquitous mirror systems separated by Markov blankets and enclosed blankets-within-blankets arise throughout neocortex, creating the typical order and response characteristics of columnar and noncolumnar cortex.",

Despite the promise this theory holds for theorising, research and practical applications in psychology and psychiatry, its impact on these disciplines has only now begun to bear fruit. The aim of this treatment is to consider the extent to which active inference has informed theoretical progress in psychology, before exploring its contributions to our understanding and treatment of psychopathology. Despite facing persistent translational obstacles, progress suggests that active inference has the potential to become a new paradigm that promises to unite psychology's subdisciplines, while readily incorporating the traditionally competing paradigms of evolutionary and developmental psychology. To date, however, progress towards this end has been slow. Meanwhile, the main outstanding question is whether this theory will make a positive difference through applications in clinical psychology, and its sister discipline of psychiatry.",

In this article, we aim to clarify the nature of the relationship between the two principles by investigating the two most likely interpretations of the claims that can be found in the subject literature. According to the strong interpretation, the two principles are equivalent and apply to the same subset of physical phenomena; according to the weak interpretation, the two principles are merely analogous to each other by virtue of their similar formal structures. As we show, adopting the stronger reading would lead to a dilemma that is untenable for the proponents of the free energy principle, thus supporting the adoption of the weaker reading for the relationship between the two constructs.",

While free energy minimization, which incorporates Bayesian inference, leads to a Boolean lattice of propositions (classical logic), quantum cognition, which seems to be very dissimilar to Bayesian inference, leads to an orthomodular lattice of propositions (quantum logic). Thus, we address this challenging issue to bridge and connect the free energy minimization principle with the theory of quantum cognition. In this work, we introduce “excess Bayesian inference” and show that this excess Bayesian inference entails an underlying orthomodular lattice, while classic Bayesian inference entails a Boolean lattice. Excess Bayesian inference is implemented by extending the key idea of Bayesian inference beyond classic Bayesian inference and its variations. It is constructed by enhancing the idea of active inference and/or embodied intelligence. The appropriate lattice structure of its logic is obtained from a binary relation transformed from a distribution of the joint probabilities of data and hypotheses by employing a rough-set lattice technique in accordance with quantum cognition logic.",

Many researchers have expressed doubts regarding the actual integration of PP with the FEP, questioning whether the FEP can truly contribute significantly to the mechanistic understanding of PP or even undermine such integration altogether. In this paper, I present an alternative perspective. I argue that, from the viewpoint of the constraint-based mechanisms approach, the FEP imposes an important constraint, namely variational free energy, on the mechanistic architecture proposed by PP. According to the constraint-based mechanisms approach, high-level cognitive mechanisms are integral parts of extensive heterarchical networks that govern the physiology and behavior of agents. Consequently, mechanistic explanations of cognitive phenomena should incorporate constraints and flows of free energy as relevant components, given that the implemented constraints operate as long as free energy is available. Within this framework, I contend that the FEP provides a relevant constraint for explaining at least some biological cognitive mechanisms described in terms of Bayesian generative models that minimize prediction errors.",

The hypothalamus regulates energy homeostasis and is functionally connected to cortical and subcortical regions especially the frontal areas.\n\nObjectivesWe tested network-targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net-tDCS) to influence the excitability of brain regions involved in appetite control.\n\nMethodsIn a randomized, double-blind parallel group design, 44 adults with overweight or obesity (BMI 30.6 kg/m2, 52.3 % female) received active (anodal or cathodal) or sham 12-channel net-tDCS on the hypothalamus appetite-control network for 25 minutes on three consecutive days while performing a Stop-Signal-Task to measure response inhibition. Before and after stimulation, state questionnaires assessed changes in desire to eat and food craving. Directly after stimulation, participants received a breakfast buffet to evaluate ad-libitum food intake. An oral glucose tolerance test was conducted at follow-up. Resting-state functional MRI was obtained at baseline and follow-up.\n\nResultsThe Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) was shorter in both active groups versus sham, indicating improved response inhibition. Additionally, a stronger increase in hypothalamic functional connectivity was associated with shorter SSRT. Caloric intake of sweet food was lower in the anodal group versus sham, but no main effects between groups were observed on total and macronutrient intake, food craving ratings and desire to eat. At follow-up, no differences were observed between groups on peripheral metabolism.\n\nConclusionOur study suggests that modulating hypothalamic functional network connectivity patterns via net-tDCS may improve food choice and inhibitory control.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/24318873v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1869c1forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@73e837org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@192b3bcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5632d0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIActive net-tDCS groups showed better inhibitory control compared to the sham group.\nC_LIO_LIStronger increase in hypothalamic functional connectivity associated with better inhibitory control after active net-tDCS.\nC_LIO_LINo differences were found between the active net-tDCS and sham groups for total kilocaloric intake.\nC_LIO_LIAnodal net-tDCS showed lower sweet food intake compared to the sham group.\nC_LI",

      "abstract": "Predictive processing theories are increasingly popular in philosophy of mind; such process theories often gain support from the Free Energy Principle (FEP)—a normative principle for adaptive self-organized systems. Yet there is a current and much discussed debate about conflicting philosophical interpretations of FEP, e.g., representational versus non-representational. Here we argue that these different interpretations depend on implicit assumptions about what qualifies (or fails to qualify) as representational. We deploy the Free Energy Principle (FEP) instrumentally to distinguish four main notions of representation, which focus on organizational, structural, content-related and functional aspects, respectively. The various ways that these different aspects matter in arriving at representational or non-representational interpretations of the Free Energy Principle are discussed. We also discuss how the Free Energy Principle may be seen as a unified view where terms that traditionally belong to different ontologies—e.g., notions of model and expectation versus notions of autopoiesis and synchronization—can be harmonized. However, rather than attempting to settle the representationalist versus non-representationalist debate and reveal something about what representations are simpliciter, this paper demonstrates how the Free Energy Principle may be used to reveal something about those partaking in the debate; namely, what our hidden assumptions about what representations are—assumptions that act as sometimes antithetical starting points in this persistent philosophical debate.",

Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approaches have been used to offload LLM inference tasks to servers. However, existing solutions suffer from data inefficiency, insensitivity to latency requirements, and non-adaptability to task load variations. In this paper, we propose an active inference with rewardless guidance algorithm using expected future free energy for offloading decisions and allocating resources for the LLM inference task offloading and resource allocation problem of cloud-edge networks systems. Experimental results show that our proposed method has superior performance over mainstream DRLs, improves in data utilization efficiency, and is more adaptable to changing task load scenarios.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Interoception-the nervous system's sensing, integration, and interpretation of internal bodily signals-facilitates the dynamic alignment of internal states with external environments. Predictive processing theory posits that this alignment arises from iterative comparisons between predicted and actual sensory inputs. Persistent mismatches in these computations may drive interoceptive dysfunction, a core mechanism implicated in anxiety disorders. Despite advances, a significant gap remains in linking computational models of interoceptive dysregulation to clinical interventions. This review synthesizes evidence to propose an interoceptive computational framework to bridge mechanistic insights with therapeutic innovation for anxiety.<h4>Methods</h4>This review synthesizes evidence from computational psychiatry, neurophysiology, and clinical studies to model anxiety as a disorder of interoceptive prediction. We integrate predictive coding mechanisms underlying threat perception with the potential of experimental paradigms and bidirectional modulation strategies for intervention.<h4>Results</h4>Anxiety pathophysiology is driven by hyperprecise threat priors and context rigidity, which amplify interoceptive prediction errors. These computational failures manifest as exaggerated defensive responses, cognitive biases, and maladaptive behaviors. Integrating computational modeling with targeted interventions, such as interoceptive exposure grounded in Bayesian belief updating, improves diagnostic precision and therapeutic outcomes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>By bridging computational theories of interoceptive dysregulation with clinical practice, this framework advances a multidimensional approach to anxiety disorders. Future research should prioritize perturbed-prior experiments and hybrid interventions to optimize personalized treatment. Such integration holds transformative potential for precision psychiatry, addressing both neural computations and embodied experiences in anxiety.",

We present here the first detailed description of an active inference framework to auditorily-guided speech production. We compare the architecture of active inference models to existing computational models of speech motor control, and describe an active inference account of how compensation and adaptation result from perturbations of auditory feedback. We highlight several unique aspects of active inference, as well as emerging hypotheses for future empirical work. In particular, active inference accounts emphasise a role for proprioception in speech motor learning, and offer the potential to model the effects of other voices on speech production in phenomena such as phonetic convergence.</p>",

I first show that psychoanalytic therapies require a setting (made up of several envelopes), a particular psychic state and specific processes (transference, free association, dreaming, play, reflexivity and narrativity) in order to induce psychic transformations. I then analyze how these processes of transformations operate and how they can be enlightened by the FEP. I first underline the fact that psychoanalytic therapies imply non-linear processes taking time to unfold and require a setting containing high entropy processes. More precisely, these processes are characterized by an interplay between extension and reduction of free energy. This interplay also favors the emergence of new orders of subjective experience, which occur following states of disorder, according to a certain energetic threshold allowing the modification and improvement of mental functioning. These high entropy states are also characterized by random functioning and psychic malleability which favors the exploration of subjective experience in an original manner. Overall, the approach proposed in this paper support the dialogue between psychoanalysis and other fields of research while underlining how psychoanalytical theoretical and conceptual constructs can also be useful to other disciplines, in particular the neurosciences of subjectivity.",

      "abstract": "Friston proposed the Minimum Free Energy (MFE) principle based on the Variational Bayesian (VB) method. This principle inherits the basic idea of Evolutionary System Theory. Still, it emphasizes the coordination between the brain, behavior, and the environment, promoting self-organization. However, there are two issues with VB and the MFE principle: 1) When using VB to optimize latent variables, the Variational Free Energy (VFE) F may not always decrease; 2) The concept of VFE is inconsistent with physical free energy. The author proposed the semantic information G theory and R(G) function 30 years ago (R is the minimum mutual information for the given semantic mutual information G). Based on the study of the R(G) function, this paper proposes the Semantic Variational Bayesian (SVB) and the Maximum Information Efficiency (MIE) principle to resolve the two issues with VB and the MFE principle. Theoretic analysis and computing experiments prove that R–G = F-H(X|Y) instead of F continues to decrease when optimizing latent variables. The experiments show that SVB is reliable and straightforward for latent variables and active inference. This paper also explains the relationship between information, entropy, and free energy in local non-equilibrium and equilibrium systems, concluding that Shannon&#039;s information is similar to free energy&#039;s increment, semantic information is similar to exergy&#039;s increment, and VFE is equivalent to some physical entropy. The MIE principle inherits the basic idea of the MFE principle but is easier to understand and apply.",

This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).In contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).I first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?</p>",

      "abstract": "Why do some rhythms make us want to move and not others? A predictive processing account suggests that prediction errors drive this phenomenon, but this hypothesis remains underspecified. Here, we operationalized this account as a Bayesian model that infers whether a rhythmic sequence is caused by a metered or unmetered template, coupled with an active inference rule in which movement occurs if the sensory feedback from movement would reduce the prediction errors generated by this inference process. Surprisal, as an index of prediction error, was calculated for each rhythm with and without a metronome (a proxy for the feedback from moving along), with delta surprisal as the difference. Surprisal increased linearly as a function of rhythmic complexity, while delta surprisal showed a similar pattern with urge to move ratings shown in previous studies, and this relation was confirmed in an online study. These results suggest that the urge to move to music is driven by the potential to reduce meter-based prediction errors via the expected feedback from moving along to the beat. This work provides a crucial update to the predictive processing account and highlights a key role of active inference and prediction-based learning in our musical experiences.",

Behavioral-cognitive \"profiles\" lack a justified principle linking function to experience, and the awareness case study illustrates how externally specified goals can just as well underwrite as-if (pseudo-intentional) control rather than original intentionality. Moreover, the proposed heuristic overlooks that substrate similarity is currently indispensable for justifiably inferring the presence of consciousness beyond the validated case of the adult human brain.

      "abstract": "This article introduces the linguistic active inference theory, which proposes that inner speech augments the brain's predictive processes by transforming prior expectations and sensorimotor predictions to help reduce prediction error and uncertainty. By leveraging language's unique properties-its efficiency in representing sensorimotor information, its ability to extend across time and space, and its generativity in constructing novel predictions-inner speech enables predictive processes to transcend immediate experience, encoding complex sensory experiences into linguistic forms for perceptual inference while decoding abstract goals into situated actions for active control. Linguistic active inference theory provides a unifying framework explaining how inner speech's diverse functions, varied phenomenology, and neurocognitive developmental mechanisms all emerge from its augmentation of perceptual inference and active control. It posits that inner speech dynamically adapts its form and function in response to computational demands and ongoing prediction errors to reduce the imprecision in the brain's generative model. This synthesis advances foundational theories and provides a roadmap for future research: generating novel testable hypotheses, motivating a shift toward dynamic and integrative methodologies, and opening new perspectives on related mental phenomena and the broader role of symbolic systems in cognition.

Traditional neuroscientific approaches often concentrate on isolated facets, such as perceptual awareness or the global state of consciousness and construct a theory around the relevant empirical paradigms and findings. Theories of consciousness are, therefore, often difficult to compare; indeed, there might be little overlap in the phenomena such theories aim to explain. Here, we take a different approach: starting with active inference, a first principles framework for modelling behaviour as (approximate) Bayesian inference, and building up to a minimal theory of consciousness, which emerges from the shared features of computational models derived under active inference. We review a body of work applying active inference models to the study of consciousness and argue that there is implicit in all these models a small set of theoretical commitments that point to a minimal (and testable) theory of consciousness.",

In these tasks, temporal patterns are provided, followed by linguistically specified task goals. Training is performed in a supervised manner by minimizing the free energy, and goal-directed tasks are performed using the active inference (AIF) framework. Our simulation results show that the best task performance is obtained when two working memory modules are used instead of one or none and when self-directed inner speech is incorporated during task execution. Detailed analysis indicates that a temporal hierarchy develops in the stacked RNN module under these optimal conditions. We argue that the model's capacity for generalization across novel task configurations is supported by the structured interplay between working memory and the generation of self-directed language outputs during task execution. This interplay promotes internal representations that reflect task structure, which in turn support generalization by enabling a functional separation between content encoding and control dynamics within the memory architecture.",

      "abstract": "A phylogenetic split ∼7.5 Ma (million years ago) separated paninan ancestors that were unlike today's chimpanzees, from homininan ancestors that were unlike Homo sapiens today; neither had evolved into their modern physical and behavioural forms. Those paninans gave rise to the mainly frugivorous woodland-dwelling chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), whose multifemale-multimale troops have social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal interest in their offspring, interest being provided mainly by mothers or female alloparents. Contrary to widespread conjecture that the social arrangements of Pan were those of primaeval homininans, it is proposed here that ∼4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had 4 consequences that impinged on homininan evolution, differentiating it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans: (1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats of homininan social units, each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be foraged, scavenged, eaten, or carried away, within perhaps a 2-hour walk; (2) Whatever was forageable, scavengeable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any period of the year, so social units were increasingly omnivorous and necessarily small; (3) Smallness demanded cognitive ingenuity and transmissibility of existential information acquired by active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, thanks to the cognitive broadening of homininan \"zones of bounded surprisal\" (ZBS) with respect to paninans' ZBS, both within each homininan \"small-world\" social unit and between nearby homininan units spreading out, in space and time, as budding very small-world information networks; (4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sporadic collaboration between social units with mixed-sex philopatry (perhaps present ∼4 Ma among Australopithecus anamensis), behaviour which, together with (a) the generation of information within each unit that is enhanced by the intimate proximity to toddlers and children of older females and males in small mixed-sex social units, and (b) mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners establishing mixed-sex social units at newly-formed localities nearby, was behaviour that maintained not only heterozygosity, but also, crucial cognitive awareness of kinship links favouring transmissibility of information and cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units, and was behaviour that represented evolutionary cognitive and social divergence from paninans. The vulnerability of small fragile social units implies there were hundreds of false dawns between ∼4 Ma and ∼40,000 BCE when even Homo neanderthalensis had vanished, leaving only our prehistoric Homo sapiens ancestors bearing \"Homo informatio's\" highly-evolved hierarchically mechanistic mind with its unequalled wide cognitive \"zone of bounded surprisal\" (ZBS) grounded in active inference in accord with the free energy principle.",

While many studies have focused on models that best fit behavioural data, the extent to which such models reflect biologically plausible mechanisms remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we developed a probabilistic two-armed bandit task model grounded in the active inference framework and evaluated its performance against established reinforcement learning (RL) models. Our model not only matched but outperformed conventional RL models in explaining individual variability in choice behaviour. A central feature of our model is the optimisation of policy precision based on previous outcomes. This process captures the dynamic balance between model-based predictions derived from the internal generative model and the influence of immediate past observations. Importantly, incorporating the temporal dynamics of policy precision significantly improved the model's capacity to explain large-scale brain network activity and inter-subject variability. We found that increases in policy precision were positively associated with default mode network dominance and negatively associated with states dominated by dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. These opposing associations suggest functional coordination between these systems, as supported by the correlations between brain state transitions and behavioural parameters. Furthermore, prolonged dominance of another brain state, characterised by elevated ventral attention network activity and stronger inter-network connectivity, appeared to disrupt this coordination. Finally, we found that heightened sensitivity to negative outcomes in a loss-related context was associated with high suicidal risk among individuals with major depressive disorder.",

Our key insight is that MCTS, already renowned for its search efficiency, can be naturally extended to incorporate free energy minimization by blending expected rewards with information gain. Concretely, the cross-entropy method (CEM) is used to optimize action proposals at the root node, while tree expansions leverage reward modeling alongside intrinsic exploration bonuses. This synergy allows our planner to maintain coherent estimates of value and uncertainty throughout planning, without sacrificing computational tractability. Empirically, we benchmark our planner on a diverse set of continuous control tasks, where it demonstrates performance gains over both stand-alone CEM and MCTS with random rollouts.",

The model characterizes linguistic processing as inference over a hierarchical generative model, facilitating predictions and inferences at various levels of granularity, from syllables to sentences. Our approach combines the strengths of large language models for realistic textual predictions and active inference for guiding eye movements to informative textual information, enabling the testing of predictions. The model exhibits proficiency in reading both known and unknown words and sentences, adhering to the distinction between lexical and nonlexical routes in dual route theories of reading. Our model therefore provides a novel approach to understand the cognitive processes underlying reading and eye movements, within a predictive processing framework. Furthermore, our model can potentially aid in understanding how maladaptive predictive processing can produce reading deficits associated with dyslexia. As a proof of concept, we show that attenuating the contribution of priors during the reading process leads to incorrect inferences and a more fragmented reading style, characterized by a greater number of shorter saccades, aligning with empirical findings regarding eye movements in dyslexic individuals. In summary, our model represents a significant advancement in comprehending the cognitive processes involved in reading and eye movements, with potential implications for understanding dyslexia in terms of maladaptive inference.",

However, reducing the surrounding environment into a small set of simpler hypotheses remains a challenge in highly dynamic contexts. In this study, we propose an approach, based on active inference, that employs dynamic priors sampled from reduced versions of a generative model. Each dynamic prior corresponds to an alternative evolution of the world, which the agent can evaluate by accumulating continuous data. We test our approach on two everyday tasks: inferring a trajectory and grasping a moving object.

      "abstract": "Can active inference model consciousness? We offer three conditions implying that it can. The first condition is the simulation of a world model, which determines what can be known or acted upon; namely an epistemic field. The second is inferential competition to enter the world model. Only the inferences that coherently reduce long-term uncertainty win, evincing a selection for consciousness that we call Bayesian binding. The third is epistemic depth, which is the recurrent sharing of the Bayesian beliefs throughout the system. Due to this recursive loop in a hierarchical system (such as a brain) the world model contains the knowledge that it exists. This is distinct from self-consciousness, because the world model knows itself non-locally and continuously evidences this knowing (i.e., field-evidencing). Formally, we propose a hyper-model for precision-control, whose latent states (or parameters) encode and control the overall structure and weighting rules for all layers of inference. These globally integrated preferences for precision enact the epistemic agency and flexibility reminiscent of general intelligence. This Beautiful Loop Theory is also deeply revealing about altered states, meditation, and the full spectrum of conscious experience.",

      "abstract": "Sustaining the robot's longevity becomes challenging in dynamic deployments characterized by new unknown environments and embodiments outside of the prior knowledge. Hence, the knowledge of robot-environment interactions needs to be continually updated for system adaptation. It can be implemented through self-verification as a continual comparison of predictions with observations using the predictive coding (PC) principle. The principle has been further extended into the active inference control (AIC) in biomimetic robotics to drive the control, state estimation, and model update. However, continually updating one model leads to catastrophic forgetting in the long term. Therefore, we propose an autonomously expanding self-verifying world model (WM) of sensorimotor dynamics utilized in model-based gait control. The model combines PC with the incremental knowledge representation based on the internal model (IM) principle. The proposed method is experimentally validated in virtual and real scenarios, where the hexapod walking robot has to recognize and adapt to leg paralysis and then recognize the recovery. The method generates novel behaviors in real time, improving the performance and outperforming the examined state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the robot's decisions and gained knowledge are interpretable and promise further functional scalability.",

This work shows that synaptic pruning facilitates efficient statistical structure learning. We extend previously established canonical neural networks to derive a synaptic pruning scheme that is formally equivalent to an online Bayesian model selection. The proposed scheme, termed Bayesian synaptic model pruning (BSyMP), utilizes connectivity parameters to switch between the presence (ON) and absence (OFF) of synaptic connections. Mathematical analyses reveal that these parameters converge to zero for uninformative connections, thus providing reliable and efficient model reduction. This enables the identification of a plausible structure for the environmental model, particularly when the environment is characterized by sparse likelihood and transition matrices. Through causal inference and rule learning simulations, we demonstrate that BSyMP achieves model reduction more efficiently than the conventional Bayesian model reduction scheme. These findings indicate that synaptic pruning could be a neuronal substrate underlying structure learning and generalizability in the brain.",

This paper develops the thesis that anticipation depends on memory. In living systems, stored information about past states enables the prediction and modulation of future behavior. Drawing on Robert Rosen's theory of anticipatory systems, Friston's free-energy principle, and recent examples from microbiology, immunology, and cognition, I argue that Rosen's \"model\" is the organized memory of a system. Memory-whether mechanical, chemical, genetic, epigenetic, bioelectric, neural, or cultural-provides the substrate for anticipation, projecting possible futures and constraining present behavior. Examples across biological scales illustrate how this works in practice. Bacteria record viral encounters and use these genomic memories to defend against reinfection. In E. coli, biochemical traces of past interactions direct chemotaxis. Yeast cells store epigenetic stress memories that accelerate adaptation. With the advent of nervous systems, anticipation becomes centralized in internal neural models, enabling flexible simulations of organism-environment interactions. In all cases, anticipatory memory underlies teleonomy as goal-directedness that emerges from evolutionary and developmental processes. Top-down causation plays a central role in shaping the constraints that give rise to purposive, self-maintaining behavior. System-level goals emerge from past-informed constraints, giving living systems their distinctive autonomy, adaptivity, and creativity.",

This way of thinking highlights the role of memory as an essential resource for observation, and makes it clear that \"memory\" and \"time\" are also mutually inter-defined, complementary concepts. We formulate our approach in terms of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) of Friston and colleagues and the fundamental idea from quantum theory that physical interactions can be represented by linear operators. Following Levin (2024) [30], we emphasize that memory is, first and foremost, an interpretative function, from which the idea of memory as a record, at some level of accuracy, of past events is derivative.

Active Inference (AI) is a way of representing this dysfunctional signal processing. According to the AI approach, all neuronal processing and action selection can be explained by maximizing Bayesian model evidence or minimizing variational free energy. Following these principles, it has been suggested that dysconnection in neuronal networks results in aberrant belief updating and erroneous inference, leading to psychiatric and neurologic symptoms. However, there is a classic distinction between disorders of inference (or synaptopathy-including the majority of psychiatric disorders) and disorders of brain function (including vascular neurological pathologies and severe forms of tauopathy and synucleinopathies). This distinction is generally based on the idea that synaptopathies impair neuromodulatory precision weighting, leading to rigid inferences or heightened sensitivity to noise, while disorders of brain function are linked to damage in the nervous system (disconnection). This makes it challenging to apply the logic of the free energy principle. We suggest that this distinction will enable future models of neuropsychiatric symptoms to be improved by considering more than neuronal message passing.",

A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic: How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns? To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference on the basis of the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced substantially by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuomotor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience.",

The algorithm requires stochastic elements, and a simplified model based on a magnetic artificial spin ice geometry is used to illustrate how nanomagnets can generate the required random dynamics. Examples of tracking and PID control are demonstrated and shown to be consistent with the original stochastic differential equation formulation of active inference. Interestingly, nonlinear response in the form of spikes and spike trains not predicted by the original theory can appear in the nanomagnet system for certain temperature regimes. A theoretical approach using a mean-field approximation for spin systems is proposed, which describes the transition to nonlinear response. Finally, the possibility to create simple magnetic arrays using realistic models is shown with micromagnetic simulations of a simple 17 element array of nanomagnets that include magnetic anisotropies, and exchange and dipolar interactions. Possible applications are simulated to illustrate how nanomagnetic arrays can be used as the stochastic element for feedback control of processes, investigation and control of magnetic state evolution, and as a method to optimize pulsed field magnetic switching protocols.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The free energy principle and its corollary, the active inference framework, serve as theoretical foundations in the domain of neuroscience, explaining the genesis of intelligent behavior. This principle states that the processes of perception, learning, and decision making—within an agent—are all driven by the objective of “minimizing free energy,” evincing the following behaviors: learning and employing a generative model of the environment to interpret observations, thereby achieving perception, and selecting actions to maintain a stable preferred state and minimize the uncertainty about the environment, thereby achieving decision making. This fundamental principle can be used to explain how the brain processes perceptual information, learns about the environment, and selects actions. Two pivotal tenets are that the agent employs a generative model for perception and planning and that interaction with the world (and other agents) enhances the performance of the generative model and augments perception. With the evolution of control theory and deep learning tools, agents based on the FEP have been instantiated in various ways across different domains, guiding the design of a multitude of generative models and decision-making algorithms. This letter first introduces the basic concepts of the FEP, followed by its historical development and connections with other theories of intelligence, and then delves into the specific application of the FEP to perception and decision making, encompassing both low-dimensional simple situations and high-dimensional complex situations. It compares the FEP with model-based reinforcement learning to show that the FEP provides a better objective function. We illustrate this using numerical studies of Dreamer3 by adding expected information gain into the standard objective function. In a complementary fashion, existing reinforcement learning, and deep learning algorithms can also help implement the FEP-based agents. Finally, we discuss the various capabilities that agents need to possess in complex environments and state that the FEP can aid agents in acquiring these capabilities.",

      "abstract": "The visual quality of perceptions is highly correlated with the mechanisms of the human brain and visual system. Recently, the free-energy principle, which has been widely researched in brain theory and neuroscience, is introduced to quantize the perception, action, and learning in human brain. In the field of image quality assessment (IQA), on one hand, the free-energy principle can resort to the internal generative model to simulate the visual stimulus of the human beings. On the other hand, abundant psychological and neurobiological studies reveal that different frequency and orientation components of one visual stimulus arouse different neurons in the striate cortex, and the striate cortex processes visual information in the cerebral cortex. Motivated by these two aspects, a novel reduce-reference IQA metric called the multi-channel free-energy based reduced-reference quality metric is proposed in this paper. First, a two-level discrete Haar wavelet transform is used to decompose the input reference and distorted images. Next, to simulate the generative model in the human brain, the sparse representation is leveraged to extract the free-energy-based features in subband images. Finally, the overall quality metric is obtained through the support vector regressor. Extensive experimental comparisons on four benchmark image quality databases (LIVE, CSIQ, TID2008, and TID2013) demonstrate that the proposed method is highly competitive with the representative reduced-reference and classical full-reference models.",

      "abstract": "The free energy principle is notoriously difficult to understand. In this paper, we relate the principle to a framework that philosophers of biology are familiar with: Ruth Millikan’s teleosemantics. We argue that: (i) systems that minimise free energy are systems with a proper function; and (ii) Karl Friston’s notion of implicit modelling can be understood in terms of Millikan’s notion of mapping relations. Our analysis reveals some surprising formal similarities between the two frameworks, and suggests interesting lines of future research. We hope this will aid further philosophical evaluation of the free energy principle.",

      "abstract": "People who habituate to stress show a repetition-induced response attenuation—neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, neuroenergetic, and emotional—when exposed to a threatening environment. But the exact dynamics underlying stress habituation remain obscure. The free energy principle offers a unifying account of self-organising systems such as the human brain. In this paper, we elaborate on how stress habituation can be explained and modelled using the free energy principle. We introduce habituation priors that encode the agent’s tendency for stress habituation and incorporate them in the agent’s decision-making process. Using differently shaped goal priors—that encode the agent’s goal preferences—we illustrate, in two examples, the optimising (and thus habituating) behaviour of agents. We show that habituation minimises free energy by reducing the precision (inverse variance) of goal preferences. Reducing the precision of goal priors means that the agent accepts adverse (previously unconscionable) states (e.g., lower social status and poverty). Acceptance or tolerance of adverse outcomes may explain why habituation causes people to exhibit an attenuation of the stress response. Given that stress habituation occurs in brain regions where goal priors are encoded, i.e., in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and that these priors are encoded as sufficient statistics of probability distributions, our approach seems plausible from an anatomical-functional and neuro-statistical point of view. The ensuing formal and generalisable account—based on the free energy principle—further motivate our novel treatment of stress habituation. Our analysis suggests that stress habituation has far-reaching consequences, protecting against the harmful effects of toxic stress, but on the other hand making the acceptability of precarious living conditions and the development of the obese type 2 diabetes mellitus phenotype more likely.",

      "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder is a debilitating and increasingly prevalent psychiatric condition (Compton et al., 2006; Andersen et al., 2011). At present, its primary treatments are antidepressant medications and psychotherapy. Curiously, although the pharmacological effects of antidepressants manifest within hours, remission of clinical symptoms takes a number of weeks-if at all. Independently, support has grown for an idea-proposed as early as Helmholtz (von Helmholtz, 1924)-that the brain is a prediction machine, holding generative models for the purpose of inferring causes of sensory information (Dayan et al., 1995; Rao and Ballard, 1999; Knill and Pouget, 2004; Friston et al., 2006; Friston, 2010). If the brain does indeed represent a collection of beliefs about the causal structure of the world, then the depressed phenotype may emerge from a collection of depressive beliefs. These beliefs are modified gradually through successive combinations of expectations with observations. As a result, phenotypic remission ought to take some time as the brain's relevant statistical structures become less pessimistic.",

In contrast, we proposed that the ventral attention system is regulated by the ventral limbic division, regulating feedback constraints and error-correction for active inference within the neocortical hierarchy. Here, we propose that these forms of cognitive control reflect vertical integration of subcortical arousal control systems that evolved for specific forms of behavior control. The feedforward impetus to action is regulated by phasic arousal, mediated by lemnothalamic projections from the reticular activating system of the lower brainstem, and then elaborated by the hippocampus and dorsal limbic division. In contrast, feedback constraint-based on environmental requirements-is regulated by the tonic activation furnished by collothalamic projections from the midbrain arousal control centers, and then sustained and elaborated by the amygdala, basal ganglia, and ventral limbic division. In an evolutionary-developmental analysis, understanding these differing forms of active affordance-for arousal and motor control within the subcortical vertebrate neuraxis-may help explain the evolution of active inference regulating the cognition of expectancy and error-correction within the mammalian 6-layered neocortex.",

      "abstract": "Associative learning is a behavioral phenomenon in which individuals develop connections between stimuli or events based on their co-occurrence. Initially studied by Pavlov in his conditioning experiments, the fundamental principles of learning have been expanded on through the discovery of a wide range of learning phenomena. Computational models have been developed based on the concept of minimizing reward prediction errors. The Rescorla-Wagner model, in particular, is a well-known model that has greatly influenced the field of reinforcement learning. However, the simplicity of these models restricts their ability to fully explain the diverse range of behavioral phenomena associated with learning. In this study, we adopt the free energy principle, which suggests that living systems strive to minimize surprise or uncertainty under their internal models of the world. We consider the learning process as the minimization of free energy and investigate its relationship with the Rescorla-Wagner model, focusing on the informational aspects of learning, different types of surprise, and prediction errors based on beliefs and values. Furthermore, we explore how well-known behavioral phenomena such as blocking, overshadowing, and latent inhibition can be modeled within the active inference framework. We accomplish this by using the informational and novelty aspects of attention, which share similar ideas proposed by seemingly contradictory models such as Mackintosh and Pearce-Hall models. Thus, we demonstrate that the free energy principle, as a theoretical framework derived from first principles, can integrate the ideas and models of associative learning proposed based on empirical experiments and serve as a framework for a better understanding of the computational processes behind associative learning in the brain.",

These models suggest that introducing sensory surprise into the patient-therapist system can lead to self-organization and the formation of new attractor states, disrupting entrenched patterns of thoughts, emotions, and behaviours. We propose that the therapist can facilitate this process by cultivating epistemic trust and modulating embodied attention to allow surprising affective states to enter shared awareness. Transient increases in free energy enable the update of generative models, expanding the range of experiences available within the patient-therapist phenomenal field. We hypothesize that patterns of disorganization at behavioural and physiological levels, indexed by increased entropy, complexity, and lower determinism, are key markers and predictors of psychotherapeutic gains. Future research should investigate how the therapist's openness to novelty shapes therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objectives To study whether the free energy principle can explain fetal brain activity and the existence of fetal consciousness via a chaotic dimension derived using artificial intelligence. Methods In this observational study, we used a four-dimensional ultrasound technique obtained to collect images of fetal faces from pregnancies at 27–37 weeks of gestation, between February and December 2021. We developed an artificial intelligence classifier that recognizes fetal facial expressions, which are thought to relate to fetal brain activity. We then applied the classifier to video files of facial images to generate each expression category’s probabilities. We calculated the chaotic dimensions from the probability lists, and we created and investigated the free energy principle’s mathematical model that was assumed to be linked to the chaotic dimension. We used a Mann–Whitney test, linear regression test, and one-way analysis of variance for statistical analysis. Results The chaotic dimension revealed that the fetus had dense and sparse states of brain activity, which fluctuated at a statistically significant level. The chaotic dimension and free energy were larger in the sparse state than in the dense state. Conclusions The fluctuating free energy suggests consciousness seemed to exist in the fetus after 27 weeks.",

FEP holds that cognitive systems encode generative models of their niches and cognition can be understood in terms of minimizing the free energy of these models. There are two philosophical interpretations of this picture. A computationalist will argue that as FEP claims that Bayesian inference underpins both perception and action, it entails a concept of cognition as a computational process. An enactivist, on the other hand, will point out that FEP explains cognitive systems as constantly self-organizing to non-equilibrium steady-state. My claim is that these two interpretations are both true at the same time and that they enlighten each other.",

      "abstract": "How the purposive behavior of living systems outstrips the constraints of the free energy principle.\n                  Since 2005, Karl Friston's proposal that the principle of free energy minimization underpins the purposive behavior of living agents has evolved through thousands of publications. This principle's central move is to formalize the drive for self-preservation in terms of a single probabilistic imperative: to survive, a living system must consistently exhibit the same “most likely” pattern of activity over time. Despite the simplicity of this central claim, the free energy principle's complexity and rate of development have previously made it difficult to identify and evaluate. In A Drive to Survive, Kathryn Nave offers an extended critical analysis of the strengths and limitations of Friston's proposal.\n                  Nave shows that the free energy principle's capacity to account for the biological origins of purposiveness is undermined by its applicability to any stable inanimate system. As this triviality has become apparent, so advocates have begun to reframe the free energy principle as a means to eliminate, rather than explain, the notion of distinctively biological purposiveness. This, Nave proposes, gets things the wrong way around. The triviality of free energy minimization does not prove that there is no difference in kind between living agents and ordinary machines, but rather it reflects that the framework cannot capture the intrinsic instability and unpredictability that distinguish the former.",

Leveraging the formal equivalence between neural network dynamics and variational Bayesian inference, we constructed biologically plausible synthetic agents capable of active inference. These agents recapitulated individual variability in zebrafish neuronal dynamics and behaviour by identifying subject-specific prior and posterior beliefs.

Characterized by multi-round interactions and social uncertainty, repeated games more closely resemble real-world social scenarios, where the decision-making process involves interconnected cognitive components such as inference, policy selection, and learning. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning models, active inference, grounded in the free energy minimization principle, unifies perception, learning, planning, and action within a single generative model. Belief updating is achieved by minimizing variational free energy, while the exploration-exploitation dilemma is balanced by minimizing expected free energy. Formulated based on partially observable Markov decision processes, the framework naturally incorporates social uncertainty, and its hierarchical structure allows for simulating mentalizing processes, thereby offering a unified account of social decision-making. Future research can further validate its effectiveness through model simulation and behavioral fitting.",

The principle is based on the the-ory of the predictive brain, particularly the concept of Active Inference, and viewsany usability problem as a user’s “prediction error.” For the operationalization of thisprinciple, the paper also introduces the “Neuro-energetic Model of Friction” (NEM)—apractical method for analyzing user experience through the lens of cognitive resourcemanagement, detailed in Appendix B.Research OutcomesThe proposed model demonstrates high explanatory power and the ability to unify ex-isting knowledge by reinterpreting modern and classic laws, such as those of Fitts andHick, as ways to reduce cognitive load, interpreting Nielsen’s heuristics as strategiesfor minimizing various types of friction (cognitive, procedural, emotional), analyzingmore complex aspects of interaction including trust, ethics, and aesthetics, and intro-ducing the “Thrust” concept for creating a positive user experience.Practical ApplicationThe work outlines the development prospects for the “Active Inference User Interface”(AIUI) - a new generation of interfaces that embody the zero-friction principle in prac-tice.ConclusionsThe research proposes a transition from a disparate set of rules to a more cohesiveconceptual framework for design.

      "abstract": "<p>Persistent Postural Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD) is a common and disabling chronic disorder, comprising core symptom clusters involving perceived (i.e., subjective) unsteadiness during upright posture and intolerance for self- and visual motion. There are diagnostic criteria, conceptual models and therapeutic approaches to managing specific components of PPPD, such as physiotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and anti-depressant medication. However, no diagnostic tests or unifying neurobiological basis for the condition exists. PPPD has been viewed as a subtype of functional neurological disorder (FND), sharing some similarities in altered brain function and behaviour, but lacks other hallmarks of FND. Here, using the framework of Active Inference - in which both action and perception are based on internal predictions about the state of the body and the world and their precision (estimated reliability) - we define a singular neurobiological process responsible for core PPPD symptoms: namely, a failure to attenuate precision-weighted prediction error (PWPE) during self-motion, leading to subjective postural instability. Specifically, self-motion prediction errors per se are not increased, but their precision weighting is, thereby reducing the relative precision of self-motion predictions. More simply, this reflects a shift of operating mode from top-down, efficient ‘autopilot’ to a ‘feedback’ mode, dominated by bottom-up sensory processing errors. Ordinarily, experience-dependent learning naturally produces a drift to the autopilot mode, but we present four processes - each potentially present in any individual and characterised by a positive feedback loop - that keep the system stuck in a feedback mode, resulting in PPPD: elevated attention/vigilance; perceptual inferences of imbalance; preventative or corrective movement behaviours; and over-reliance on visual inputs. This model can form the basis of tools for clinical assessment and management. Finally, the foundation of our model – on defined and measurable neurobiological processes – affords testable hypotheses for investigative work and lends itself to computational modelling. A modified version of the model can also explain other forms of chronic dizziness without structural causes, like Mal de débarquement syndrome (MdDS), or ‘unexplained dizziness’ in later life.</p>",

We cast this release of mental tensing as corresponding to a hierarchical level-specific reduction in belief precision, permitting the interpretation of Buddhist notions such as equanimity and meditative stillness under AIF. We then illustrate the deconstruction process up to its conclusion in a cessation of phenomenal experience, touching on how states traversed during the process may inform areas related to core-knowledge structuring and the generation of experience.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Perception and action form a feedback loop through which organisms gather information to guide behaviour. Yet many theories still treat perception as a passive process, disconnected from the movements that shape sensory input and the bodily rhythms that sustain life. Here we advance a framework that integrates active sensing, defined as voluntary control of sensing through movement, with interoceptive physiology and links both to the architecture of action-perception coupling in active inference. We propose that cardiac and respiratory cycles modulate sensory precision and motor readiness, creating rhythmic windows during which perception and action may be most effective. Drawing on active inference, Bayesian, information, and control theories, we outline how interoceptive signals shape decisions about when to look, touch, or move, that is, the policies governing sensing and action. Within this view, agents exploit bodily rhythms through active sensing, gathering sensory data during phases of the cardiorespiratory cycle that favour perceptual precision and adjusting the timing of sensing and action when these cycles enter suppressive phases. Because respiration is partly voluntary, it provides a means to fine-tune these dynamics and align sensing with favourable physiological states. We further formalise how interoceptive and exteroceptive information interact under limited processing capacity to modulate inferences about the environment. Together, these principles establish interoception as a component of active sensing and position cognition as an embodied, temporally coordinated process emerging from the joint dynamics of brain, body, and environment.</p>",

However, the computational mechanisms underlying such meditative “deconstruction” are not well understood, with no formal computational models available to explicate how deconstruction alters perception and action during meditation. Using the active inference framework, I demonstrate that the phenomenology of deconstruction–in terms of conceptual attenuation, reduced reactivity and shorter temporal scale perception–naturally emerges from the dynamics of hierarchical inference when the deconstructive notion of letting go is cast as a reduction in belief precision over hidden states at a specific level of the generative model. I present a formal hierarchical three-level generative model and simulate deconstruction as an intervention in a facial recognition task, where the agent selects a letting go policy when perceived affective valence becomes excessively negative. The results demonstrate that the capacity to deconstruct permits agents to self-regulate experienced affect via letting go. I furthermore propose that the proposed letting go mechanism may underlie the emergence of minimal phenomenal experiences such as pure awareness states. The model offers a novel perspective within the paradigm of computational phenomenology on conceptual attenuation, equanimity, stillness and affect during meditative deconstruction.</p>",

Notwithstanding its inherently simple and elegant idea - agents minimise surprise, otherwise known as free energy, through a blief and action updating process referred to as active inference - real-world application has been limited due to computational complexity and the abstract nature of the mathematical framework. This paper introduces FEP to travel behaviour research, developing an active inference model of route choice under uncertainty and applying it to two experimental datasets. Results demonstrate that the FEP model outperforms alternatives based on reinforcement learning (RL), particularly for individuals displaying exploratory or belief- adaptive behaviour. While computationally more demanding, the FEP framework offers substantial advantages in capturing learning dynamics, habit formation, and uncertainty-driven adaptation in travel decision-making, positioning it as a promising neurocomputational foundation for future travel behaviour models.</p>",

The first condition is the simulation of a world model, which determines what can be known or acted upon; namely an epistemic field. The second is inferential competition to enter the world model. Only the inferences that coherently reduce long-term uncertainty win, evincing a selection for consciousness that we call Bayesian binding. The third is epistemic depth, which is the recurrent sharing of the Bayesian beliefs throughout the system. Due to this recursive loop in a hierarchical system (such as a brain) the world model contains the knowledge that it exists. This is distinct from self-consciousness, because the world model knows itself non-locally and continuously evidences this knowing (i.e., field-evidencing). Formally, we propose a hyper-model for precision-control, whose latent states (or parameters) encode and control the overall structure and weighting rules for all layers of inference. These globally integrated preferences for precision enact the epistemic agency and flexibility reminiscent of general intelligence. This Beautiful Loop Theory is also deeply revealing about altered states, meditation, and the full spectrum of conscious experience.</p>",

      "abstract": "This theoretical paper proposes a novel synthesis of the neurodynamic framework of active inference with phenomenological and systemic models of psychological change. Building on the \"criticality of consciousness\" hypothesis (Tucker et al., 2025), consciousness is understood as the balanced interplay of an excitatory (E) predictive and an inhibitory (I) corrective limbic system. To imbue this formal architecture with content, concepts from the Resonance-Inference Model (RIM) are integrated (Leidig, 2025a) to describe the brain's generative model as a phenomenological self-pattern. The principles of synergetics (Haken, 1983) are applied to model psychological transformation as a non-linear phase transition. The central contribution is the thesis that the highest level of the self-pattern—the spiritual self (Leidig, 2025b)—acts as a synergetic control parameter governing the entire neurocognitive dynamic. Based on the slaving principle, a mechanism of downward causation is articulated, whereby a change in this high-level parameter directly modulates the precision-weighting of the neurodynamic E/I balance. The model offers a plausible, non-reductionist explanation for how mental states like meaning and belief can have causal effects on brain dynamics. It builds a bridge between computational neuroscience and humanistic psychology, providing a unified framework for understanding psychopathology and therapeutic change.",

By unifying previously disparate aspects of inner speech research, LAIT provides a comprehensive framework explaining how its diverse functions, varied phenomenology, and theoretical models emerge from its implementation of perceptual inference and active control through dynamic linguistic predictions, adapting to computational demands and fluctuating uncertainties across contexts.

      "abstract": "In this simulation study, we adopt the comprehensive neurocomputational approach of Active Inference (AIF) to illustrate some key concepts of Material Engagement Theory (MET) [1]. MET posits that craftwork does not require, or rely on, rich internal ‘pre-planning’, i.e., complex and highly detailed representations that occur mainly in the maker’s head. Instead, the maker engages materiality through ’thinging’ , where the human agent (the maker) is guided by and leverages the materiality of the artefact (such as a spinning of clay or a chunk of marble). MET assigns a crucial co-participatory role to materiality, attributing agency to it. We investigate MET’s claims through the widely adopted theory of AIF [2]. Our first aim is to simulate the plausibility of the (creative) thinging , adopting a simple modelling scenario. Then, we also discuss its applicability to other, more complex cases, which seem to require greater levels of ‘pre-thinking’ (e.g., planning, imagining and conceptualising outcomes). We highlight how these cases, too, align with the general principle of thinging . With our AIF neurocomputational understanding, we explain that even in these situations, the predictive brains involved in the creative process attempt to minimise the complexity of their internal model. The upshot of this is that, always and everywhere, our human minds engage the materiality to make the most of the characteristic dynamics of the world surrounding us - things and processes alike.",

      "abstract": "Did very “small-world” networks enhance the Darwinian fitness of primaeval Homo through exchanges of information that enabled exploration of resources beyond those exploitable at hand? An active inference suggestion is offered about the early evolution of human social behaviour. A phylogenetic split ~7.5 Ma (million years ago) separated paninan ancestors that were unlike today's chimpanzees, and homininan ancestors that were unlike Homo sapiens today; neither had evolved into their modern physical and behavioural forms. Those paninans later became mainly frugivorous woodland-dwelling Pan whose multifemale-multimale troops have social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal interest in their offspring, interest being provided mainly by mothers or female alloparents. Contrary to widespread conjecture that the aforementioned social arrangement was that of primaeval homininans, it is proposed here that by 4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had 4 consequences that impinged on homininan evolution, differentiating it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans: (1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be foraged, scavenged, eaten, or carried away, within perhaps a 2-hour walk; (2) Whatever was forageable, scavengeable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any period of the year, so social units were increasingly omnivorous and necessarily small; (3) Smallness demanded cognitive ingenuity and transmissibility of existential information acquired by active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, thanks to the cognitive broadening of homininan “zones of bounded surprisal” (ZBS) with respect to paninans' ZBS, both within each homininan “small-world” social unit and between nearby homininan units spreading out, in space and time, as budding very small-world information networks (eventually reaching Australia and America, propagated by H. sapiens during the Upper Pleistocene); (4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sporadic collaboration between social units with mixed-sex philopatry (perhaps present ~4 Ma among Australopithecus anamensis), behaviour which, together with (a) the generation of information within each unit that is enhanced by the intimate proximity to toddlers and children of older females and males in small mixed-sex social units, and (b) mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners establishing mixed-sex social units at neolocalities nearby, was behaviour that maintained not only heterozygosity, but also, crucial cognitive awareness of kinship links favouring transmissibility of information and cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units, and was behaviour that represented evolutionary cognitive and social divergence from paninans. The vulnerability of small fragile social units implies that there were hundreds of false dawns between ~4 Ma (Australopithecus anamensis) and ~40,000 BCE when all other homininan “palaeospecies” (including Homo neanderthalensis) had become extinct, leaving prehistoric Homo sapiens alone to roam the world, blessed with \"Homo informatio's\" highly-evolved hierarchically mechanistic mind with its unequalled wide cognitive “zone of bounded surprisal” (ZBS) grounded in active inference in accord with the free energy principle.",

      "abstract": "<p>The active inference framework (AIF) considers the brain as a generative model guiding behavior under the imperative of minimizing the model’s variational free energy. Computationally, this is accomplished by hierarchical Bayesian inference. The theory views organisms as doxastic agents, which has drawn the criticism of being insufficient to explain conative agents motivated by desire. Specifically, it has been noted that the concept of desire is not isomorphic with belief and, therefore, fits poorly with AIF. In this paper, we build on previous work that suggests a path to integrating conation in AIF and present three arguments. First, the dichotomy between belief and desire is unnecessary. To that end, we define desire as a hierarchical inference that starts from a domain-general inference on the agent’s affective dynamics (affective charge) and descends to contextualized inference on the precision of action policies. We suggest that this hierarchy is implemented by a coordinated activity of the intrinsic brain networks: default mode, action mode, executive, and salient. Second, we argue for a central role that deferred action plays in the process of desire by allowing for affect-dependent awareness of the agent’s states over different timescales. Third, we suggest that the proposed model of desire and deferred action has ramifications for understanding psychopathology, which we frame as the malfunction of deferred action and desire and use obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression as examples. This view entails that disorders of affect and motivation are subjectively desired despite their associated suffering.</p>",

Recent studies in the frontal cortex have revealed that multiple elements of a sequence are represented simultaneously in separable neural subspaces, challenging classical serial models of sequential planning. Here, we show that these representations emerge naturally under inferential planning in which sequential actions are inferred from sensory evidence and goals. Using a hierarchical generative model, we reproduce key neural phenomena observed in primate frontal cortex, including the simultaneous activation of multiple plan elements, the emergence of (almost) orthogonal ‘memory’ subspaces, and their reuse across forward and backward sequence tasks. Our approach provides a mechanistic account of how probabilistic inference over control states gives rise to distributed and dynamic neural representations of plans. This framework not only unifies previously disparate findings on planning, working memory, and motor preparation, but also generates novel, testable predictions about the dynamics of active inference, the role of sensory subspaces, and the impact of uncertainty on sequence processing.",

      "abstract": "We advance a novel formulation of cognitive control within the active inference framework. The theory proposes that cognitive control amounts to optimising a precision parameter, which acts as a control signal and balances the contributions of deliberative and habitual components of action selection. To illustrate the theory, we simulate a driving scenario in which the driver follows a well-known route, but encounters unexpected challenges. Our simulations show that a standard active inference model can form adaptive habits; i.e., can pass from deliberative to habitual control when the context is stable, but generally fails to revert to deliberative control, when the context changes. To address this failure of context-sensitivity, we introduce a novel type of hierarchical active inference, in which a lower level is responsible for behavioural control and the higher (or meta-cognitive) level observes the belief updating of the lower level below and is responsible for cognitive control. Crucially, the meta-cognitive level can both form habits and suspend them, by controlling the (precision) parameter that prioritizes deliberative choices at the behavioural level. Furthermore, we show that several processes linked to cognitive control - such as surprise detection, cognitive conflict monitoring, control signal regulation and specification, the simulation of future outcomes and the assessment of the costs of control and mental effort - stem coherently from the free energy minimization scheme that underpins active inference. Finally, we discuss the putative neurobiology of cognitive control by simulating brain dynamics in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways of the dopamine system, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the locus coeruleus.",

While evolution has been successfully abstracted and mathematically modelled, the concept of a self-sustaining system has so far resisted a comparable level of formalisation. This paper tackles this challenge by reframing the concept of self-sustaining system within a more abstract framework to study `agents': goal-directed systems acting in an environment. We build on an existing conceptual framework comprising three requirements for agents: individuality, normativity (or goal-directedness), and interactional asymmetry. We then provide a systematic analysis, under a unified notation, of several mathematical approaches aiming to formalise these requirements, including the free energy principle, integrated information theory and dynamical systems. Unlike this conceptual framework, which commits to an intrinsic perspective on agency, we focus on a less ontologically committed `as-if' stance. Using this, we discuss links between identity and normativity, and a way to understand actions as if they were produced by causal interventions. Taken together, our systematic analysis clarifies the limitations of current proposals and reveals how they can work synergistically within a unified, mathematical account of agency across natural and artificial domains.</p>",

A Coherence Principle—expressed as the variational stationarity condition “delta A = 0”—governs lawful differentiations within this field and preserves the core phenomenological invariants of unity, binding, temporal continuity, and reflexive presence. The familiar variational laws then appear as embedded projections: “delta S = 0” (least action) for physics and “delta F = 0” (free-energy stationarity) for inference. Subbeings (local bounded centres of coherent differentiation), defined by Markov blankets, are local equilibria of the global coherence field; their inferential activity sustains rather than produces awareness. A Qualia Mapping Function links differentiations in awareness to measurable information-geometric structures. AFT predicts lawful dissociations between coherence (“delta A”) and inference (“delta F”) - as in dreaming, illusion, psychedelics, and meditation, where phenomenological unity persists despite inferential error. It thereby unifies phenomenology, physics, and cognition within a single variational hierarchy (delta S and delta F as subsets of delta A), dissolves the explanatory gap by grounding experience in its own coherence, and resolves the combination problem by making unity fundamental, a variational calculus of Being underlying all appearance.</p>",

It addresses the fundamental question of how maladaptive core beliefs, which create a state of inner dissonance, can be lastingly changed. We conceptualize core beliefs as high-precision hyper-priors within a hierarchical generative model of the self, based on Karl Friston's free energy principle. Psychopathology is framed as a state of chronically elevated free energy, manifesting as a stable, yet painful, attractor landscape. The RIM synthesizes six theoretical pillars—predictive processing (Friston), the self-pattern theory (Gallagher), synergetics (Haken et al.), affect logic (Ciompi), spatiotemporal neuroscience (Northoff), and consistency theory (Grawe)—into a coherent, multi-level framework. It argues that therapeutic change is a synergetic phase transition from dissonance to resonance, a more adaptive and energetically favorable state. This process requires multi-level interventions that destabilize the old attractor and facilitate the consolidation of a new one. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a vertical, spiritual dimension, conceptualizing Viktor Frankl's \"will to meaning\" as a master-prior capable of initiating a global reorganization of the self-pattern through downward causation. The RIM thus provides a unified, process-based, and neuroscientifically grounded blueprint for psychotherapy and personal change.</p>",

It argues that the persistent mind-body problem is a consequence of a flawed substance ontology and the representationalist framework it necessitates. To overcome this, the paper constructs a critical synthesis of three influential anti-representationalist strands: Robert Brandom’s linguistic inferentialism as a “top-down” approach, the embodied and enactive theory of mind as a “bottom-up” approach, and the Resonance-Inference Model (RIM) as a unifying scientific framework. Drawing on Schopenhauer’s revolutionary turn to the lived body (Leib) as a non-representational access to reality, the paper traces a continuous path from basic biological normativity to the complex social normativity of human reason. By reinterpreting the Free Energy Principle (FEP) through an enactive lens (“enactive inference”) and employing the concept of formal downward causation from synergetics, the RIM provides a scientifically grounded mechanism for mental causation without resorting to dualism or reductionism. The resulting framework offers an integrated, multi-scale description of the mind as an embodied, self-organizing process, with significant implications for understanding psychopathology and critiquing contemporary rationalist theories.",

      "abstract": "Hierarchical encoding is a structural element of the Free Energy Principle and related information-centric accounts of brain function, but a concrete circuit-level mechanism for it remains elusive. Here we examine Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation (HAM). In this computationally grounded scheme, information is encoded in the envelope of a carrier and slower brain rhythms multiplicatively modulate the amplitude of faster rhythms, creating a cascade of nested oscillatory envelopes. This multiplicative architecture naturally produces intermodulation frequencies (of the form  f c + Σ  a i f i ). It predicts that oscillation frequency bands should be log-spaced (  r ≳ 2–3, depending on the number of modulation layers) to avoid spectral overlap, as in constant-Q filter banks, consistent with the observed logarithmic spacing of canonical brain rhythms (with ratios ∼2–3). HAM’s log-uniform distribution yields a 1  /f global spectral profile and 1  /f α sideband spectra in the broadband “aperiodic” component, with the slope determined by modulation depth and band ratio. We then demonstrate modulation and demodulation in the laminar neural mass model (LaNMM), where a fast excitatory-inhibitory oscillator circuit couples with a slower cortical oscillator (Janse-Rit). Through the network’s intrinsic nonlinearities and cross-frequency coupling, amplitude modulation and demodulation are implemented. These results provide a novel circuit-level mechanism for hierarchical predictive coding, linking theoretical principles to observed spectral features of brain activity.  <h4>Highlights</h4>  We introduce HAM  1 : a principle for the organization of hierarchical information processing in the brain. Information is encoded through amplitude modulation, where faster rhythms are multiplicatively modulated by slower processes. Information can thus live in signals or their envelopes (and envelopes of envelopes).  The required intermodulation structure for band protection,  f c ± Σ  a i f i , finds a natural implementation in near geometric (log) spacing with a frequency ratio  r ≳ 2–3 (strong super-increasing hierarchy), yielding constant fractional bandwidths and enabling staged demodulation.  In addition to geometric frequency spacing, HAM provides two routes to 1  /f α : (i) a cascade link  α = 2 ln(2  /m )  / ln  r ; (ii) a log-uniform mixture that yields 1  /f in expectation with constant-Q kernels.  We provide a proof of concept modulation and demodulation implementation in NMM using the LaNMM with PING-like fast generators as carriers and JR-like slow generators for envelope extraction.",

A mechanism of downward causation is postulated, in which meaning and values function as the highest-level order parameter, shaping neural dynamics by modulating precision weighting.

This paper develops the thesis that anticipation depends on memory. In living systems, stored information about past states enables the prediction and modulation of future behavior. Drawing on Robert Rosen’s theory of anticipatory systems, Friston’s free-energy principle, and recent examples from microbiology, immunology, and cognition, I argue that Rosen’s “model” is the organized memory of a system. Memory—whether mechanical, chemical, genetic, epigenetic, bioelectric, neural, or cultural—provides the substrate for anticipation, projecting possible futures and constraining present behavior.Examples across biological scales illustrate how this works in practice. Bacteria record viral encounters and use these genomic memories to defend against reinfection. In E. coli, biochemical traces of past interactions biase chemotaxis. Yeast cells store epigenetic stress memories that accelerate adaptation. With the advent of nervous systems, anticipation becomes centralized in internal neural models, enabling flexible simulations of organism–environment interactions.In all cases, anticipatory memory underlies teleonomy as goal-directedness that emerges from evolutionary and developmental processes. Top-down causation plays a central role in shaping the constraints that give rise to purposive, self-maintaining behavior. System-level goals emerge from past-informed constraints, giving living systems their distinctive autonomy, adaptivity, and creativity.",

While both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms governing their interaction and role in individual differences remain poorly understood. <h4>Methods:</h4> We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes G–µ coupling. Bifurcation analysis of the model’s potential function yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–µplane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and µ via hierarchical Bayesian learning. <h4>Results:</h4> Canonical cusp and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts corresponding to psychological phenomena from stable belief convergence to cognitive polarization and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G= 1, µ= 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory extension (Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics; SGBD) represents person-specific traits with structural matrices to capture mixed-emotion states. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics. It provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for empirical studies, including longitudinal and neurophysiological designs. Bridging concepts from Mathematical Psychology to control-theoretic frameworks like Perceptual Control Theory and the Free Energy Principle, our model offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, and psychiatry.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>A phylogenetical split, beginning perhaps between 8 and 6 Ma (million years ago) came to separate paninan ancestors that were unlike today's chimpanzees, and homininan ancestors that were unlike Homo sapiens today; neither had yet evolved into their modern physical and behavioural forms. The former were to become woodland-dwellers in multifemale-multimale troops with social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal investment or interest in their offspring, which is the preserve of mothers. Contrary to widespread conjecture that the aforementioned social arrangement was that of primeval homininans, a \"heretical\" proposal is that by 4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (consisting of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had three consequences that would impinge on homininan evolution and differentiate it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans, namely: (1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be scrounged, foraged, eaten, or carried away, within a 2-hour walk; (2) Whatever was scroungeable, forageable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any time of the year, which meant that voracious social units were necessarily small; (3) Smallness which, in turn, demanded ingenuity and the transmissibiity of existential information in the form of active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, by virtue of the broadening of homininan \"zones of bounded surprisal\" with respect to paninans' zones, both within each homininan social unit and between adjoining homininan units in the landscape, which spread geographically over time as budding small-world information networks (and eventually reached Australia and America, propagated by H. sapiens during the Late (Upper) Pleistocene);(4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sometimes collaboration between social units (maybe ca. 4.2 Ma in Australopithecus anamensis), which, together with the generation of information within each unit, favoured paternal investment in child-rearing in mixed-sex social units and by mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners with establishment of mixed-sex social units at neolocalities nearby (mixed-sex philopatry), which maintained not only heterozygosity but also, most important, kinship links that favoured cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units: all of that marked a major behavioural shift away from paninan social arrangements. The vulnerability of small fragile social units implies that there were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of false dawns between ~4.2 Ma (Australopithecus anamensjs) and ~40,000 BCE when all other homininan palaeospecies (including Homo neanderthalensis) had become extinct, leaving Homo sapiens alone in prehistory to roam around the world, the sole depositary of our now highly-evolved homininan hierarchically mechanistic mind conditioned by our unparallelled wide zone of bounded surprisal grounded in active inference in accord with the free energy principle.</p>",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a curiosity algorithm for sample efficient data collection in robotic task learning. Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most commonly used algorithms for robotic task learning. In general, RL agents explore the environment by random actions. However, random exploration results in poor sample efficiency when the state-action space is continuous and high-dimensional, such as in a robotic object manipulation task. By making the robot curious, the robot would become interested in the unknown region and explore that region. In order to make the robot curious, we utilize the free energy principle, which has been attracting attention in the field of neuroscience and AI. We propose a curiosity algorithm that combines with Soft Actor-Critic and show that it is naturally derived from the free energy principle. Moreover, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in simulation and real-world experiments of robotic object manipulation task learning.",

      "abstract": "Several authors have made claims about the compatibility between the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and theories of autopoiesis and enaction. Many see these theories as natural partners or as making similar statements about the nature of biological and cognitive systems. We critically examine these claims and identify a series of misreadings and misinterpretations of key enactive concepts. In particular, we notice a tendency to disregard the operational definition of autopoiesis and the distinction between a system’s structure and its organization. Other misreadings concern the conflation of processes of self-distinction in operationally closed systems with Markov blankets. Deeper theoretical tensions underlie some of these misinterpretations. FEP assumes systems that reach a non-equilibrium steady state and are enveloped by a Markov blanket. We argue that these assumptions contradict the historicity of agency and sense-making that is explicit in the enactive approach. Enactive concepts such as adaptivity and agency are defined in terms of the modulation of parameters and constraints of the agent-environment coupling, which entail the possibility of redefinition of variable and parameter sets and of the dynamical laws affecting a system, a situation that escapes the assumptions of FEP. In addition, the enactive perspective foregrounds the enabling and constitutive roles played by the world in sense-making, agency, development, and the path-dependent diversity of human bodies and minds. We argue that this position is also in contradiction with the FEP. Once we move beyond superficial similarities, identify misreadings, and examine the theoretical commitments of the two approaches, we reach the conclusion that the FEP, as it stands formulated today, is profoundly incompatible with the theories of autopoiesis and enaction.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we extend the free-energy principle to video quality assessment (VQA) by incorporating with the recent psychophysical study on human visual speed perception (HVSP). A novel video quality metric, namely the free-energy principle inspired video quality metric (FePVQ), is therefore developed and applied to perceptual video coding optimization. The free-energy principle suggests that the human visual system (HVS) can actively predict \"orderly\" information and avoid \"disorderly\" information for image perception. Basically, \"orderly\" is associated with the skeletons and edges of objects, and \"disorderly\" mostly concerns textures in images. Based on this principle, an image is separated into orderly and disorderly regions, and processed differently in image quality assessment. For videos, visual attention, or fixation, is associated with the objects with significant motion according to HVSP, resulting in a motion strength factor in the FePVQ so that the free-energy principle is extended into spatio-temporal domain for VQA. In addition, we investigate the application of the FePVQ in perceptual rate distortion optimization (RDO). For this purpose, the FePVQ is realized with low computational cost by using the relative total variation model and the block-wise motion vectors of video coding to simulate the free-energy principle and the HVSP, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed FePVQ is highly consistent with the HVS perception. The linear correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient are up to 0.8324 and 0.8281 on the LIVE video database. Better perceptual quality of encoded video sequences is achieved by FePVQ-motivated RDO in video coding.",

The first of these is that the free energy principle gives us a self-sufficient explanation of what all cognitive systems consist in: a specific computational architecture. The second is that all adaptive behavior is driven by the free energy principle and the process of model-based inference it entails. The third is that cognition is not ubiquitous. These three incompatible propositions together comprise a problem of scope for the free energy principle as a theory of cognition. The prospects for rejecting each of these propositions are considered. To drop either the first or the second would limit the explanatory success of the principle. However, there are plausible ways to bite the bullet on denial of the third proposition. In particular, I argue that it is possible for the free energy theorist to admit that cognition is ubiquitous in biological systems while reserving conceptual space exclusively for human cognitive capacities.",

Transformations are constructed which are built from the matrix groups and infinite products. This gives rise to many of the widely used structural models in image analysis often termed active models, essentially the deformable templates. These deformations are studied as both diffeomorphisms as well as immersions. A calculus is introduced based on transport theory for activating these deformable shapes by taking variations with respect to the matrix groups parameterizing them. Segmentation based on activating these manifolds is examined based on Gaussian random fields and variations with respect to the parameterizations.",

It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of self-organization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology.",

      "abstract": "Interoceptive processing is commonly understood in terms of the monitoring and representation of the body’s current physiological (i.e. homeostatic) status, with aversive sensory experiences encoding some impending threat to tissue viability. However, claims that homeostasis fails to fully account for the sophisticated regulatory dynamics observed in complex organisms have led some theorists to incorporate predictive (i.e. allostatic) regulatory mechanisms within broader accounts of interoceptive processing. Critically, these frameworks invoke diverse—and potentially mutually inconsistent—interpretations of the role allostasis plays in the scheme of biological regulation. This chapter argues in favor of a moderate, reconciliatory position in which homeostasis and allostasis are conceived as equally vital (but functionally distinct) modes of physiological control. It explores the implications of this interpretation for free energy-based accounts of interoceptive inference, advocating a similarly complementary (and hierarchical) view of homeostatic and allostatic processing.",

      "abstract": "A new branch of artificial intelligence called Active Inference AI is changing the very foundations of how medical knowledge is created, applied, and taught. And this new AI is combining with an entirely new evolution of the Internet, called the Spatial Web, which is changing how medical knowledge will be shared globally. Active Inference AI and the Spatial Web have been developed together to create a powerful new environment for medicine and science in general to evolve to an entirely new level. Until now, large-scale AI models called LLMs (Large Language Models) have been dominating the AI marketplace. But these are general-purpose AIs. They are expensive to create, they are massively data-hungry, and they are imprecise and not designed for specialized domains like medicine. In contrast, this new Active Inference AI-inspired by neuroscience-is designed specifically for medicine and other applications requiring high accuracy and explainable results. This new AI does not use LLM technology but relies on small, domain-specific models built from expert-curated knowledge graphs and factor graphs. This novel approach enables reasoning, learning, and decision-making within well-defined medical contexts, allowing for the precision, adaptability, and interpretability missing in LLMs. This report outlines how Active Inference AI can: (1) accelerate medical research by simulating hypotheses and causal pathways. (2) Enhance medical treatment through adaptive, real-time digital twins and precision diagnostics. (3) Revolutionize medical education by creating dynamic, interactive, and semantically accurate learning environments.",

      "abstract": "While the human auditory system is proficient on its own at discerning the direction of incoming sounds, it operates in concert with other sensory modalities to reach accurate spatial awareness. Many studies have investigated the integration of auditory and visual information, but much less attention has been given to the importance of proprioceptive and vestibular information in the localisation process. The vestibular and proprioceptive systems aid in discerning self-motion from source motion and, through this, can stabilise perception and provide additional cues for sound localisation. The aim of this PhD thesis was to better understand how head movement and position estimation affects sound localisation. To this end, an ideal-observer model, based on Bayesian principles, was developed as a tool to predict dynamic sound localisation in humans and to test how performance is affected by the available information. Behavioural experiments were conducted in conjunction with model simulations to determine the acoustic cues and head motions that are relevant to dynamic sound localisation. The results from the psychoacoustic experiments were found to be in general agreement with the model output, though some quantitative differences indicated that dynamic sound localisation may involve processes that can be considered non-ideal. These studies offer valuable insights for the field of psychoacoustics and for auditory engineering applications in modern technologies such as hearing aids and virtual or augmented reality.",

However, the manner, intensity, and overall effects of stuttering vary widely among individuals. Despite extensive scientific inquiry spanning over a century, the complex and seemingly paradoxical nature of stuttering has thwarted attempts at a unified explanation. Active inference, a predictive processing theory of sentient behavior, provides a potential account for understanding the core behaviors and diverse phenomena of stuttering. Stuttering likely arises from disruptions in perception-action cycling that facilitate the fluent sequential production of syllables. More specifically, aberrantly high sensory precision to speech-related predictions may cause the abrupt inhibition of syllable initiation, resulting in the hallmark stuttering ‘block.’ Moreover, active inference elucidates the perplexing contextual variability of stuttering behavior, such as the effects of adaptation, consistency, and distraction. Importantly, this account holds significant clinical implications for stuttering treatment, offering novel avenues for intervention.",

While a growing body of work has investigated the neurocognitive basis of EA, the neurocomputational processes underlying this ability have received limited attention. Here, we present a formal Active Inference (AI) model of emotion conceptualization that can simulate the neurocomputational (Bayesian) processes associated with learning about emotion concepts and inferring the emotions one is feeling in a given moment. We validate the model and inherent constructs by showing (i) it can successfully acquire a repertoire of emotion concepts in its “childhood”, as well as (ii) acquire new emotion concepts in synthetic “adulthood,” and (iii) that these learning processes depend on early experiences, environmental stability, and habitual patterns of selective attention. These results offer a proof of principle that cognitive-emotional processes can be modeled formally, and highlight the potential for both theoretical and empirical extensions of this line of research on emotion and emotional disorders.",

      "abstract": "AbstractWe present a normative computational theory of how neural circuitry may support visually-guided goal-directed actions in a dynamic environment. The model builds on Active Inference, in which perception and motor control signals are inferred through dynamic minimization of generalized prediction errors. The Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC) is proposed to maintain constantly updated expectations, or beliefs over the environmental state, and by manipulating them through flexible intentions it is involved in dynamically generating goal-directed actions. In turn, the Dorsal Visual Stream (DVS) and the proprioceptive pathway implement generative models that translate the high-level belief into sensory-level predictions to infer targets, posture, and motor commands. A proof-of-concept agent embodying visual and proprioceptive sensors and an actuated upper limb was tested on target-reaching tasks. The agent behaved correctly under various conditions, including static and dynamic targets, different sensory feedbacks, sensory precisions, intention gains, and movement policies; limit conditions were individuated, too. Active Inference driven by dynamic and flexible intentions can thus support goal-directed behavior in constantly changing environments, and the PPC putatively hosts its core intention mechanism. More broadly, the study provides a normative basis for research on goal-directed behavior in end-to-end settings and further advances mechanistic theories of active biological systems.",

New materialism (or neo-materialism), despite lacking a single definition, refers to a range of emerging perspectives that attempt to dismantle the long-held divisions between ontology, epistemology, and even ethics, with the aim of achieving a comprehensive transformation of naturalized thinking. In this context, new materialism provides powerful tools to reframe some of the conceptual foundations of the FEP. This paper is the first in a series that aims to systematically construct a neo-materialistic perspective for the FEP, exploring its wide-ranging implications.

Contextuality describe the property of physical states which are brought about by the very act of their observation, such as the position or momentum of individual particles in quantum settings. Based on conceptual and physical argument, we propose that contextuality drives the construction of cognitive semiotics. As such, it constitutes a fundamental component of cognition which any formal theory thereof must capture. At a conceptual level, Active Inference seems to capture the inherently contextual nature of cognitive engagement with the world. However, the Free Energy Principle cannot formalize this intuition due to its definition in terms of Dynamical Systems Theory, which comes with a well-defined space of possible states with no contextual properties. We describe the duality between agent-driven interaction and the construction of cognitive spaces which is implicit in the very concept of cognitive contextuality. In consequence, we emphasize the importance of the ontic regime called \"Participatory Realism\", and consider some ways that the FEP could integrate it.",

Friston elaborated how there were ways of making an optimal decision using active inference that can offer perspectives to advances in artificial intelligence. These methods of optimization within the context of active inference can also be used as a framework for improving brain-computer interfaces (BCI). This way, BCIs can give rise to artificial curiosity in the way Friston had described during his session. Using Friston’s free energy principle, we can optimize the criterion a BCI uses to infer the intentions of the user from EEG observations. Under Friston’s criteria for making an optimal decision, BCIs can expand their framework of optimal decision-making using active inference.",

We show that such neural networks implicitly perform active inference and learning to minimise the risk associated with future outcomes. Mathematical analyses demonstrate that this biological optimisation can be cast as maximisation of model evidence, or equivalently minimisation of variational free energy, under the well-known form of a partially observed Markov decision process model. This equivalence indicates that the delayed modulation of Hebbian plasticity—accompanied with adaptation of firing thresholds—is a sufficient neuronal substrate to attain Bayes optimal control. We corroborated this proposition using numerical analyses of maze tasks. This theory offers a universal characterisation of canonical neural networks in terms of Bayesian belief updating and provides insight into the neuronal mechanisms underlying planning and adaptive behavioural control.",

This study used a novel active transitive inference task to investigate how people learn a relational hierarchy through self-directed selection of premises. Active control improved memory for studied premises as well as transitive inferences involving items that were never experienced together. Moreover, active learners exhibited systematic search, generating sequences of overlapping premises that facilitate relational integration. Critically, however, advantages from active control were not universal: Only participants with higher working memory capacity benefited from the opportunity to select data.

      "abstract": "The present dissertation took the free-energy principle (FEP) as its starting point, from which we tried to draw both philosophical and empirical consequences. \n\nBoth chapter 2 and 3 departed from the idea that conscious perception depends on global amplification of sensory input, and that the basal ganglia (BG) and its irrigation by dopamine play a crucial role in gating information, conscious access, and the selection of a relevant internal model given available sensory data. The BG are thought to play this role due to their modulatory influence on thalamocortical connectivity. Because much of the evidence implicating the BG in these processes in humans is correlational, we explored two ways of manipulating BG activity experimentally.\n\nChapter 4 investigates the philosophical heritage implicitly touched on by the FEP, which provides an alternative philosophical and historical background for present-day research in cognitive neuroscience. Friston’s FEP has been received with great enthusiasm. With good reason: it not only makes the bold claim to a unifying theory of the brain, but it is presented as an a priori principle applicable to living systems in general. In this paper, we set out to show how the breadth of scope of Friston’s framework converges with the dialectics of Georg Hegel. Through an appeal to the work of Catherine Malabou, we aimed to demonstrate how Friston not only reinvigorates Hegelian dialectics from the perspective of neuroscience, but that the implicit alignment with Hegel necessitates a reading of the FEP from the perspective of Hegel’s speculative philosophy. It is this reading that moves beyond the discussion between cognitivism and enactivism surrounding Friston’s framework; beyond the question whether the organism is a secluded entity separated from its surroundings, or whether it is a dynamical system characterized by perpetual openness and mutual exchange. From a Hegelian perspective, it is the tension between both positions itself that is operative at the level of the organism; as a contradiction the organism sustains over the course of its life. Not only does the organism’s secluded existence depend on a perpetual relation with its surroundings, but the condition for there to be such a relation is the existence of a secluded entity. We intended to show how this contradiction – tension internalized – is at the center of Friston’s anticipatory organism; how it is this contradiction that grounds the perpetual process of free energy minimization.\n\nChapter 5 is the report of a study attempting to contrast the FEP’s perspective with that of traditional cognitive neuroscience. While the FEP casts the brain as an organism’s predictive model of how its world works and will continue to work in the future in which action is afforded a central place, research on the brain’s predictive capacities remains beholden to traditional research practices in which participants are passively shown stimuli without their active involvement (as we also did in Chapters 2 and 3). The current study is an investigation into ways in which self-generated predictions may differ from externally induced predictions. Participants completed a volatile spatial attention task under both conditions (externally/cue-induced, internally/action-induced) on different days. We used the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter, an approximate Bayesian inference model, to determine subject-specific parameters of belief-updating and inferred volatility. We found preliminary evidence in support of self-generated predictions incurring a larger reaction time cost when violated compared to predictions induced by sensory cue, which translated to participants’ increased sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility. Our results suggest that internally generated predictions may be afforded more weight, but these results are complicated by session order and duration effects, as well as a lack of statistical power.",

      "abstract": "The free energy principle states that self-organization occurs through minimization of free energy, which is a measure of potential thermodynamic work. By minimizing free energy, the organism happens to also minimize surprise over its boundary, promoting chances of survival. We discuss the ethical implications of the cognitive goal in detail from an empirical point of view, highlighting the principle of least action as a physical basis of Occam's razor, the universality of the free energy principle, and its explanation of natural selection. We explain that the free energy principle extends to groups of organisms and helps us understand group-scale adaptations and selection in biology. The free energy principle applies to all scales of organization in the organism from single cells to the entire nervous system. When this principle is taken to its logical extremes of modeling groups, populations and ecosystems, we uncover a new, evolutionarily sensible path at explaining puzzling aspects of human motivation and judgement, including ethical decisions. To minimize free energy, populations have to act to maximize gathering of information, while building effective models at mitigating changes to its dynamic structure. The free energy principle thus provides a naturalistic explanation of some of our deepest ethical intuitions, and valuable principles of social behavior. We interpret the cognitive goal that corresponds to the principle as seeking a dynamic, fruitful, yet peaceful activity that sustains the organism. This state of mind is interestingly similar to the Buddhist intuition of mental equanimity; the organism's final goal is to be at peace and harmony with the environment. Another immediately relevant aspect is that assemblies must form to promote symbiotic, synergistic, positive feedback loops, which coincides with the findings of ecologists. Therefore, ethics naturally emerges in self-organizing systems. Assemblies of organisms must ultimately unite in macro-minds to achieve the greatest reduction in free energy, as well as building technological extensions of themselves to improve their capacity to do such, therefore the principle also predicts a post-singularity world-mind composed mostly of artificial intelligence.",

It is only by rejecting the presumption of a machine-style separation between structure and processes that we can capture this uniquely precarious status of living systems, in virtue of which they may be described as autonomous agents, acting towards the goal of their own continued survival.",

One fundamental yet underexplored aspect of brain and body interactions is the link between the respiratory and the nervous systems. In this article, we give an overview of the emerging literature on how respiration modulates neural, cognitive and emotional processes. Moreover, we present a perspective linking respiration to the free-energy principle. We frame volitional modulation of the breath as an active inference mechanism in which sensory evidence is recontextualized to alter interoceptive models. We further propose that respiration-entrained gamma oscillations may reflect the propagation of prediction errors from the sensory level up to cortical regions in order to alter higher level predictions. Accordingly, controlled breathing emerges as an easily accessible tool for emotional, cognitive, and physiological regulation.",

The paper is organised into four parts: the characterisation of the natural world under the Gaia Hypothesis, the employment of the FEP as a description of the behaviour of self-organising systems, the application of the FEP to Gaia to understand coupling dynamics between living systems and purportedly non-living planetary processes, and the offering of positive interventions for addressing the current state of ecological crisis under this framework. For the latter, we emphasise the importance of perturbing stuck states for healthy development, and the necessary appreciation of life existing as nested systems at multiple levels in a hierarchy. We propose the development of human biophilia virtue in accordance with the FEP as a practical intervention for treating biophilia deficiency syndrome and helping to safeguard the balance of planetary processes and the integrity of living systems that depend on them, offering some examples of what this might look like in practice. Overall, this paper provides novel insights into how to catalyse meaningful ecological change, proposing a deliberate and disruptive approach to addressing the dysfunctional relationship between humans and the rest of the natural world.",

      "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a normative computational framework for iterativereduction of prediction error and uncertainty through perceptioneintervention cycles thathas been presented as a potential unifying theory of all brain functions (Friston, 2006). Anytheory hoping to unify the brain sciences must be able to explain the mechanisms ofdecision-making, an important cognitive faculty, without the addition of independent,irreducible notions. This challenge has been accepted by several proponents of the FEP(Friston, 2010; Gershman, 2019). We evaluate attempts to reduce decision-making to theFEP, using Lucas' (2005) meta-theory of the brain's contextual constraints as a guidepost.We find reductive variants of the FEP for decision-making unable to explain behavior incertain types of diagnostic, predictive, and multi-armed bandit tasks. We trace the shortcomings to the core theory's lack of an adequate notion of subjective preference or “utility”, a concept central to decision-making and grounded in the brain's biological reality. We argue that any attempts to fully reduce utility to the FEP would require unrealistic assumptions, making the principle an unlikely candidate for unifying brain science. Wesuggest that researchers instead attempt to identify contexts in which either informationalor independent reward constraints predominate, delimiting the FEP's area of applicability.To encourage this type of research, we propose a two-factor formal framework that cansubsume any FEP model and allows experimenters to compare the contributions ofinformational versus reward constraints to behavior.",

      "abstract": "Research in clinical neuroscience is founded on the idea that a better understanding of brain (dys)function will improve our ability to diagnose and treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. In recent years, neuroscience has converged on the notion that the brain is a ‘prediction machine,’ in that it actively predicts the sensory input that it will receive if one or another course of action is chosen. These predictions are used to select actions that will (most often, and in the long run) maintain the body within the narrow range of physiological states consistent with survival. This insight has given rise to an area of clinical computational neuroscience research that focuses on characterizing neural circuit architectures that can accomplish these predictive functions, and on how the associated processes may break down or become aberrant within clinical conditions. Here, we provide a brief review of examples of recent work on the application of predictive processing models of brain function to study clinical (psychiatric) disorders, with the aim of highlighting current directions and their potential clinical utility. We offer examples of recent conceptual models, formal mathematical models, and applications of such models in empirical research in clinical populations, with a focus on making this material accessible to clinicians without expertise in computational neuroscience. In doing so, we aim to highlight the potential insights and opportunities that understanding the brain as a prediction machine may offer to clinical research and practice.",

Here, we propose the predictive processing framework for brain function as a promising candidate for providing this systematic foundation. The proposal is motivated by that framework’s ability to address three general challenges to identifying the neural correlates of consciousness, and to satisfy two constraints common to many theories of consciousness. Implementing the search for neural correlates of consciousness through the lens of predictive processing delivers strong potential for predictive and explanatory value through detailed, systematic mappings between neural substrates and phenomenological structure. We conclude that the predictive processing framework, precisely because it at the outset is not itself a theory of consciousness, has significant potential for advancing the neuroscience of consciousness.",

      "abstract": "This article considers the evolution of brain architectures for predictive processing. We argue that brain mechanisms for predictive perception and action are not late evolutionary additions of advanced creatures like us. Rather, they emerged gradually from simpler predictive loops (e.g. autonomic and motor reflexes) that were a legacy from our earlier evolutionary ancestors—and were key to solving their fundamental problems of adaptive regulation. We characterize simpler-to-more-complex brains formally, in terms of generative models that include predictive loops of increasing hierarchical breadth and depth. These may start from a simple homeostatic motif and be elaborated during evolution in four main ways: these include the multimodal expansion of predictive control into an allostatic loop; its duplication to form multiple sensorimotor loops that expand an animal's behavioural repertoire; and the gradual endowment of generative models with hierarchical depth (to deal with aspects of the world that unfold at different spatial scales) and temporal depth (to select plans in a future-oriented manner). In turn, these elaborations underwrite the solution to biological regulation problems faced by increasingly sophisticated animals. Our proposal aligns neuroscientific theorising—about predictive processing—with evolutionary and comparative data on brain architectures in different animal species.

      "abstract": "This paper formulates the action of psychedelics by integrating the free-energy principle and entropic brain hypothesis. We call this formulation relaxed beliefs under psychedelics (REBUS) and the anarchic brain, founded on the principle that-via their entropic effect on spontaneous cortical activity-psychedelics work to relax the precision of high-level priors or beliefs, thereby liberating bottom-up information flow, particularly via intrinsic sources such as the limbic system. We assemble evidence for this model and show how it can explain a broad range of phenomena associated with the psychedelic experience. With regard to their potential therapeutic use, we propose that psychedelics work to relax the precision weighting of pathologically overweighted priors underpinning various expressions of mental illness. We propose that this process entails an increased sensitization of high-level priors to bottom-up signaling (stemming from intrinsic sources), and that this heightened sensitivity enables the potential revision and deweighting of overweighted priors. We end by discussing further implications of the model, such as that psychedelics can bring about the revision of other heavily weighted high-level priors, not directly related to mental health, such as those underlying partisan and/or overly-confident political, religious, and/or philosophical perspectives. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Psychedelics are capturing interest, with efforts underway to bring psilocybin therapy to marketing authorisation and legal access within a decade, spearheaded by the findings of a series of phase 2 trials. In this climate, a compelling unified model of <i>how</i> psychedelics alter brain function to alter consciousness would have appeal. Towards this end, we have sought to integrate a leading model of global brain function, <i>hierarchical predictive coding</i>, with an often-cited model of the acute action of psychedelics, <i>the entropic brain hypothesis</i>. The resulting synthesis states that psychedelics work to relax high-level priors, sensitising them to liberated bottom-up information flow, which, with the right intention, care provision and context, can help guide and cultivate the revision of entrenched pathological priors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The free energy principle, an influential framework in computational neuroscience and theoretical neurobiology, starts from the assumption that living systems ensure adaptive exchanges with their environment by minimizing the objective function of variational free energy. Following this premise, it claims to deliver a promising integration of the life sciences. In recent work, Markov blankets, one of the central constructs of the free energy principle, have been applied to resolve debates central to philosophy (such as demarcating the boundaries of the mind). The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we trace the development of Markov blankets starting from their standard application in Bayesian networks, via variational inference, to their use in the literature on active inference. We then identify a persistent confusion in the literature between the formal use of Markov blankets as an epistemic tool for Bayesian inference, and their novel metaphysical use in the free energy framework to demarcate the physical boundary between an agent and its environment. Consequently, we propose to distinguish between “Pearl blankets” to refer to the original epistemic use of Markov blankets and “Friston blankets” to refer to the new metaphysical construct. Second, we use this distinction to critically assess claims resting on the application of Markov blankets to philosophical problems. We suggest that this literature would do well in differentiating between two different research programmes: “inference with a model” and “inference within a model.” Only the latter is capable of doing metaphysical work with Markov blankets, but requires additional philosophical premises and cannot be justified by an appeal to the success of the mathematical framework alone.",

In particular, it explores the thermodynamic concomitants of belief updating, under a variational (free energy) principle for self-organization. In brief, any (weakly mixing) random dynamical system that possesses a Markov blanket—i.e. a separation of internal and external states—is equipped with an information geometry. This means that internal states parametrize a probability density over external states. Furthermore, at non-equilibrium steady-state, the flow of internal states can be construed as a gradient flow on a quantity known in statistics as Bayesian model evidence. In short, there is a natural Bayesian mechanics for any system that possesses a Markov blanket. Crucially, this means that there is an explicit link between the inference performed by internal states and their energetics—as characterized by their stochastic thermodynamics.

      "abstract": "The locus coeruleus (LC) in the pons is the major source of noradrenaline (NA) in the brain. Two modes of LC firing have been associated with distinct cognitive states: changes in tonic rates of firing are correlated with global levels of arousal and behavioural flexibility, whilst phasic LC responses are evoked by salient stimuli. Here, we unify these two modes of firing by modelling the response of the LC as a correlate of a prediction error when inferring states for action planning under Active Inference (AI). We simulate a classic Go/No-go reward learning task and a three-arm 'explore/exploit' task and show that, if LC activity is considered to reflect the magnitude of high level 'state-action' prediction errors, then both tonic and phasic modes of firing are emergent features of belief updating. We also demonstrate that when contingencies change, AI agents can update their internal models more quickly by feeding back this state-action prediction error-reflected in LC firing and noradrenaline release-to optimise learning rate, enabling large adjustments over short timescales. We propose that such prediction errors are mediated by cortico-LC connections, whilst ascending input from LC to cortex modulates belief updating in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In short, we characterise the LC/ NA system within a general theory of brain function. In doing so, we show that contrasting, behaviour-dependent firing patterns are an emergent property of the LC that translates state-action prediction errors into an optimal balance between plasticity and stability.",

      "abstract": "Within computational neuroscience, the algorithmic and neural basis of structure learning remains poorly understood. Concept learning is one primary example, which requires both a type of internal model expansion process (adding novel hidden states that explain new observations), and a model reduction process (merging different states into one underlying cause and thus reducing model complexity via meta-learning). Although various algorithmic models of concept learning have been proposed within machine learning and cognitive science, many are limited to various degrees by an inability to generalize, the need for very large amounts of training data, and/or insufficiently established biological plausibility. Using concept learning as an example case, we introduce a novel approach for modeling structure learning-and specifically state-space expansion and reduction-within the active inference framework and its accompanying neural process theory. Our aim is to demonstrate its potential to facilitate a novel line of active inference research in this area. The approach we lay out is based on the idea that a generative model can be equipped with extra (hidden state or cause) \"slots\" that can be engaged when an agent learns about novel concepts. This can be combined with a Bayesian model reduction process, in which any concept learning-associated with these slots-can be reset in favor of a simpler model with higher model evidence. We use simulations to illustrate this model's ability to add new concepts to its state space (with relatively few observations) and increase the granularity of the concepts it currently possesses. We also simulate the predicted neural basis of these processes. We further show that it can accomplish a simple form of \"one-shot\" generalization to new stimuli. Although deliberately simple, these simulation results highlight ways in which active inference could offer useful resources in developing neurocomputational models of structure learning. They provide a template for how future active inference research could apply this approach to real-world structure learning problems and assess the added utility it may offer.",

      "abstract": "If one formulates Helmholtz's ideas about perception in terms of modern-day theories one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts. Using constructs from statistical physics it can be shown that the problems of inferring what cause our sensory input and learning causal regularities in the sensorium can be resolved using exactly the same principles. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. The ensuing scheme rests on Empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory information is generated. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of the brain's organisation and responses.In this paper, we suggest that these perceptual processes are just one emergent property of systems that conform to a free-energy principle. The free-energy considered here represents a bound on the surprise inherent in any exchange with the environment, under expectations encoded by its state or configuration. A system can minimise free-energy by changing its configuration to change the way it samples the environment, or to change its expectations. These changes correspond to action and perception respectively and lead to an adaptive exchange with the environment that is characteristic of biological systems. This treatment implies that the system's state and structure encode an implicit and probabilistic model of the environment. We will look at models entailed by the brain and how minimisation of free-energy can explain its dynamics and structure.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews recent developments under the free energy principle that introduce a normative perspective on classical economic (utilitarian) decision-making based on (active) Bayesian inference. It has been suggested that the free energy principle precludes novelty and complexity, because it assumes that biological systems-like ourselves-try to minimize the long-term average of surprise to maintain their homeostasis. However, recent formulations show that minimizing surprise leads naturally to concepts such as exploration and novelty bonuses. In this approach, agents infer a policy that minimizes surprise by minimizing the difference (or relative entropy) between likely and desired outcomes, which involves both pursuing the goal-state that has the highest expected utility (often termed \"exploitation\") and visiting a number of different goal-states (\"exploration\"). Crucially, the opportunity to visit new states increases the value of the current state. Casting decision-making problems within a variational framework, therefore, predicts that our behavior is governed by both the entropy and expected utility of future states. This dissolves any dialectic between minimizing surprise and exploration or novelty seeking.",

This framework should be able to integrate insights from several relevant disciplines: theory on embodied cognition, ecological psychology, phenomenology, dynamical systems theory, and neurodynamics. We suggest that the main task of Radical Embodied Cognitive Neuroscience is to investigate the phenomenon of skilled intentionality from the perspective of the self-organization of the brain-body-environment system, while doing justice to the phenomenology of skilled action. In previous work, we have characterized skilled intentionality as the organism's tendency toward an optimal grip on multiple relevant affordances simultaneously. Affordances are possibilities for action provided by the environment. In the first part of this paper, we introduce the notion of skilled intentionality and the phenomenon of responsiveness to a field of relevant affordances. Second, we use Friston's work on neurodynamics, but embed a very minimal version of his Free Energy Principle in the ecological niche of the animal. Thus amended, this principle is helpful for understanding the embeddedness of neurodynamics within the dynamics of the system \"brain-body-landscape of affordances.\" Next, we show how we can use this adjusted principle to understand the neurodynamics of selective openness to the environment: interacting action-readiness patterns at multiple timescales contribute to the organism's selective openness to relevant affordances. In the final part of the paper, we emphasize the important role of metastable dynamics in both the brain and the brain-body-environment system for adequate affordance-responsiveness. We exemplify our integrative approach by presenting research on the impact of Deep Brain Stimulation on affordance responsiveness of OCD patients.",

      "abstract": "Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neuromodulatory transmitter implicated in perception and learning under uncertainty. This study combined computational simulations and pharmaco-electroencephalography in humans, to test a formulation of perceptual inference based upon the free energy principle. This formulation suggests that ACh enhances the precision of bottom-up synaptic transmission in cortical hierarchies by optimizing the gain of supragranular pyramidal cells. Simulations of a mismatch negativity paradigm predicted a rapid trial-by-trial suppression of evoked sensory prediction error (PE) responses that is attenuated by cholinergic neuromodulation. We confirmed this prediction empirically with a placebo-controlled study of cholinesterase inhibition. Furthermore, using dynamic causal modeling, we found that drug-induced differences in PE responses could be explained by gain modulation in supragranular pyramidal cells in primary sensory cortex. This suggests that ACh adaptively enhances sensory precision by boosting bottom-up signaling when stimuli are predictable, enabling the brain to respond optimally under different levels of environmental uncertainty.",

      "abstract": "The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a differential brain response to violations of learned regularities. It has been used to demonstrate that the brain learns the statistical structure of its environment and predicts future sensory inputs. However, the algorithmic nature of these computations and the underlying neurobiological implementation remain controversial. This article introduces a mathematical framework with which competing ideas about the computational quantities indexed by MMN responses can be formalized and tested against single-trial EEG data. This framework was applied to five major theories of the MMN, comparing their ability to explain trial-by-trial changes in MMN amplitude. Three of these theories (predictive coding, model adjustment, and novelty detection) were formalized by linking the MMN to different manifestations of the same computational mechanism: approximate Bayesian inference according to the free-energy principle. We thereby propose a unifying view on three distinct theories of the MMN. The relative plausibility of each theory was assessed against empirical single-trial MMN amplitudes acquired from eight healthy volunteers in a roving oddball experiment. Models based on the free-energy principle provided more plausible explanations of trial-by-trial changes in MMN amplitude than models representing the two more traditional theories (change detection and adaptation). Our results suggest that the MMN reflects approximate Bayesian learning of sensory regularities, and that the MMN-generating process adjusts a probabilistic model of the environment according to prediction errors.",

      "abstract": "Ongoing brain activity has been observed since the earliest neurophysiological recordings and is found over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. It is characterized by remarkably large spontaneous modulations. Here, we review evidence for the functional role of these ongoing activity fluctuations and argue that they constitute an essential property of the neural architecture underlying cognition. The role of spontaneous activity fluctuations is probably best understood when considering both their spatiotemporal structure and their functional impact on cognition. We first briefly argue against a \"segregationist\" view on ongoing activity, both in time and space, which would selectively associate certain frequency bands or levels of spatial organization with specific functional roles. Instead, we emphasize the functional importance of the full range, from differentiation to integration, of intrinsic activity within a hierarchical spatiotemporal structure. We then highlight the flexibility and context-sensitivity of intrinsic functional connectivity that suggest its involvement in functionally relevant information processing. This role in information processing is pursued by reviewing how ongoing brain activity interacts with afferent and efferent information exchange of the brain with its environment. We focus on the relationship between the variability of ongoing and evoked brain activity, and review recent reports that tie ongoing brain activity fluctuations to variability in human perception and behavior. Finally, these observations are discussed within the framework of the free-energy principle which - applied to human brain function - provides a theoretical account for a non-random, coordinated interaction of ongoing and evoked activity in perception and behavior.",

      "abstract": "Perceptual decisions can be made when sensory input affords an inference about what generated that input. Here, we report findings from two independent perceptual experiments conducted during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a sparse event-related design. The first experiment, in the visual modality, involved forced-choice discrimination of coherence in random dot kinematograms that contained either subliminal or periliminal motion coherence. The second experiment, in the auditory domain, involved free response detection of (non-semantic) near-threshold acoustic stimuli. We analysed fluctuations in ongoing neural activity, as indexed by fMRI, and found that neuronal activity in sensory areas (extrastriate visual and early auditory cortex) biases perceptual decisions towards correct inference and not towards a specific percept. Hits (detection of near-threshold stimuli) were preceded by significantly higher activity than both misses of identical stimuli or false alarms, in which percepts arise in the absence of appropriate sensory input. In accord with predictive coding models and the free-energy principle, this observation suggests that cortical activity in sensory brain areas reflects the precision of prediction errors and not just the sensory evidence or prediction errors per se.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers goal-directed decision-making in terms of embodied or active inference. We associate bounded rationality with approximate Bayesian inference that optimizes a free energy bound on model evidence. Several constructs such as expected utility, exploration or novelty bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of free energy minimization. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding . In this paper, we consider variational Bayes as a scheme that the brain might use for approximate Bayesian inference. This scheme provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and action, which appear to be remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Active inference contextualizes optimal decision theory within embodied inference, where goals become prior beliefs. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimization, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (associated with softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solution. Crucially, this sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behaviour. The changes in precision during variational updates are remarkably reminiscent of empirical dopaminergic responses—and they may provide a new perspective on the role of dopamine in assimilating reward prediction errors to optimize decision-making.",

In this work, we explore the idea that saccadic eye movements are optimal experiments, in which data are gathered to test hypotheses or beliefs about how those data are caused. This provides a plausible model of visual search that can be motivated from the basic principles of self-organized behavior: namely, the imperative to minimize the entropy of hidden states of the world and their sensory consequences. This imperative is met if agents sample hidden states of the world efficiently. This efficient sampling of salient information can be derived in a fairly straightforward way, using approximate Bayesian inference and variational free-energy minimization. Simulations of the resulting active inference scheme reproduce sequential eye movements that are reminiscent of empirically observed saccades and provide some counterintuitive insights into the way that sensory evidence is accumulated or assimilated into beliefs about the world.",

Recent formulations of the variational free-energy principle as applied to the life sciences describe the properties of living systems, and their selection in evolution, in terms of variational inference.

This review considers a new approach based on existing theories of functional brain organisation. The free energy principle (a.k.a. active inference), and its instantiation in the Bayesian brain, offers a complete and simple formulation of mood. It has been proposed that emotions reflect the precision of – or certainty about – the predicted sensorimotor/interoceptive consequences of action. By extending this reasoning, in a hierarchical setting, we suggest mood states act as (hyper) priors over uncertainty (i.e. emotions). Here, we consider the same computational pathology in the proprioceptive and interoceptive (behavioural and autonomic) domain in order to furnish an explanation for mood disorders. This formulation reconciles several strands of research at multiple levels of enquiry.",

      "abstract": "Audio information has been bypassed by most of current visual attention prediction studies. However, sound could have influence on visual attention and such influence has been widely investigated and proofed by many psychological studies. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal saliency (MMS) model for videos containing scenes with high audio-visual correspondence. In such scenes, humans tend to be attracted by the sound sources and it is also possible to localize the sound sources via cross-modal analysis. Specifically, we first detect the spatial and temporal saliency maps from the visual modality by using a novel free energy principle. Then we propose to detect the audio saliency map from both audio and visual modalities by localizing the moving-sounding objects using cross-modal kernel canonical correlation analysis, which is first of its kind in the literature. Finally we propose a new two-stage adaptive audiovisual saliency fusion method to integrate the spatial, temporal and audio saliency maps to our audio-visual saliency map. The proposed MMS model has captured the influence of audio, which is not considered in the latest deep learning based saliency models. To take advantages of both deep saliency modeling and audio-visual saliency modeling, we propose to combine deep saliency models and the MMS model via a later fusion, and we find that an average of 5% performance gain is obtained. Experimental results on audio-visual attention databases show that the introduced models incorporating audio cues have significant superiority over state-of-the-art image and video saliency models which utilize a single visual modality.",

      "abstract": "Fueled by developments in computational neuroscience, there has been increasing interest in the underlying neurocomputational mechanisms of psychosis. One successful approach involves predictive coding and Bayesian inference. Here, inferences regarding the current state of the world are made by combining prior beliefs with incoming sensory signals. Mismatches between prior beliefs and incoming signals constitute prediction errors that drive new learning. Psychosis has been suggested to result from a decreased precision in the encoding of prior beliefs relative to the sensory data, thereby garnering maladaptive inferences. Here, we review the current evidence for aberrant predictive coding and discuss challenges for this canonical predictive coding account of psychosis. For example, hallucinations and delusions may relate to distinct alterations in predictive coding, despite their common co-occurrence. More broadly, some studies implicate weakened prior beliefs in psychosis, and others find stronger priors. These challenges might be answered with a more nuanced view of predictive coding. Different priors may be specified for different sensory modalities and their integration, and deficits in each modality need not be uniform. Furthermore, hierarchical organization may be critical. Altered processes at lower levels of a hierarchy need not be linearly related to processes at higher levels (and vice versa). Finally, canonical theories do not highlight active inference-the process through which the effects of our actions on our sensations are anticipated and minimized. It is possible that conflicting findings might be reconciled by considering these complexities, portending a framework for psychosis more equipped to deal with its many manifestations.",

This model is based upon active inference, in which subjects try to minimise their (proprioceptive) prediction error based upon posterior beliefs about the hidden causes of their (exteroceptive) sensory input. Our model appeals to a single principle--the minimisation of variational free energy--to provide Bayes optimal solutions to the smooth pursuit problem. However, it tries to accommodate the cardinal features of smooth pursuit of partially occluded targets that have been observed empirically in normal subjects and schizophrenia. Specifically, we account for the ability of normal subjects to anticipate periodic target trajectories and emit pre-emptive smooth pursuit eye movements--prior to the emergence of a target from behind an occluder. Furthermore, we show that a single deficit in the postsynaptic gain of prediction error units (encoding the precision of posterior beliefs) can account for several features of smooth pursuit in schizophrenia: namely, a reduction in motor gain and anticipatory eye movements during visual occlusion, a paradoxical improvement in tracking unpredicted deviations from target trajectories and a failure to recognise and exploit regularities in the periodic motion of visual targets. This model will form the basis of subsequent (dynamic causal) models of empirical eye tracking measurements, which we hope to validate, using psychopharmacology and studies of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "In this article we account for the way plants respond to salient features of their environment under the free-energy principle for biological systems. Biological self-organization amounts to the minimization of surprise over time. We posit that any self-organizing system must embody a generative model whose predictions ensure that (expected) free energy is minimized through action. Plants respond in a fast, and yet coordinated manner, to environmental contingencies. They pro-actively sample their local environment to elicit information with an adaptive value. Our main thesis is that plant behaviour takes place by way of a process (active inference) that predicts the environmental sources of sensory stimulation. This principle, we argue, endows plants with a form of perception that underwrites purposeful, anticipatory behaviour. The aim of the article is to assess the prospects of a radical predictive processing story that would follow naturally from the free-energy principle for biological systems; an approach that may ultimately bear upon our understanding of life and cognition more broadly.",

Although several authors have suggested a role of the mirror neuron system in interpersonal coupling, the underlying brain mechanisms are not well understood. Here we argue that more general theories of neural computations, namely predictive coding and the Free Energy Principle, could explain interpersonal coordination dynamics. Each brain minimizes coding costs by reducing the mismatch between the representations of observed and own motor behavior. Continuous mutual prediction and alignment result in an overall minimization of free energy, thus forming a stable attractor state.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers questions about continuity and discontinuity between life and mind. It begins by examining such questions from the perspective of the free energy principle (FEP). The FEP is becoming increasingly influential in neuroscience and cognitive science. It says that organisms act to maintain themselves in their expected biological and cognitive states, and that they can do so only by minimizing their free energy given that the long-term average of free energy is entropy. The paper then argues that there is no singular interpretation of the FEP for thinking about the relation between life and mind. Some FEP formulations express what we call an independence view of life and mind. One independence view is a cognitivist view of the FEP. It turns on information processing with semantic content, thus restricting the range of systems capable of exhibiting mentality. Other independence views exemplify what we call an overly generous non-cognitivist view of the FEP, and these appear to go in the opposite direction. That is, they imply that mentality is nearly everywhere. The paper proceeds to argue that non-cognitivist FEP, and its implications for thinking about the relation between life and mind, can be usefully constrained by key ideas in recent enactive approaches to cognitive science. We conclude that the most compelling account of the relationship between life and mind treats them as strongly continuous, and that this continuity is based on particular concepts of life (autopoiesis and adaptivity) and mind (basic and non-semantic).",

      "abstract": "Most existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods belong to supervised methods, which always need a large number of image samples and expensive subjective scores for training a quality prediction model. In this paper, we focus our attention on the unsupervised BIQA methods and put forward a novel unsupervised approach. The main idea of our method is to quantify the image quality degradation through measuring the structure, naturalness, and the perception quality variations of the distorted image from the pristine natural images. In specific, the structure variation is captured by the deviations of the image phase congruency and gradients distributions. The naturalness variation is characterized through the distributions variations of the locally mean subtracted and contrast normalized (MSCN) coefficients and the products of pairs of the adjacent MSCN coefficients. Compared with existing unsupervised methods, we initiatively introduce the perception quality measurement into the construction of unsupervised BIQA method, which is conducted by characterizing the prediction discrepancy between the image and its brain prediction based on the free-energy principle in the newly revealed brain theory. After feature extraction, we learn a pristine multivariate Gaussian (MVG) model with the extracted features from a set of pristine natural images. The quality of a new image is finally defined as the distance between its MVG model and the learned pristine MVG model. The extensive experiments conducted on LIVE, TID2013, CSIQ, Toyama, CID2013, and the Waterloo Exploration databases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparative prediction performance with the state-of-the-art BIQA methods.",

      "abstract": "According to the free energy principle biological agents resist a tendency to disorder in their interactions with a dynamically changing environment by keeping themselves in sensory and physiological states that are expected given their embodiment and the niche they inhabit (Friston in Nat Rev Neurosci 11(2):127–138, 2010. doi:10.1038/nrn2787). Why would a biological agent that aims at minimising uncertainty in its encounters with the world ever be motivated to seek out novelty? Novelty for such an agent would arrive in the form of sensory and physiological states that are unexpected. Such an agent ought therefore to avoid novel and surprising interactions with the world one might think. Yet humans and many other animals find play and other forms of novelty-seeking and exploration hugely rewarding. How can this be understood in frameworks for studying the mind that emphasise prediction error minimisation? This problem has been taken up in recent research concerned with epistemic action—actions an agent engages in to reduce uncertainty. However that work leaves two questions unanswered, which it is the aim of our paper to address. First, no account has been given yet of why it should feel good to the agent to engage the world playfully and with curiosity. Second an appeal is made to precision-estimation to explain epistemic action, yet it remains unclear how precision-weighting works in action more generally, or active inference. We argue that an answer to both questions may lie in the bodily states of an agent that track the rate at which free energy is being reduced. The recent literature on the predictive brain has connected the valence of emotional experiences to the rate of change in the reduction of prediction error (Joffily and Coricelli in PLoS Comput Biol 9(6):e1003094, 2013. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003094; Van de Cruys, in Metzinger and Wiese (eds) Philosophy and predictive processing, vol 24, MIND Group, Frankfurt am Main, 2017. doi:10.15502/9783958573253). In this literature valenced emotional experiences are hypothesised to be identical with changes in the rate at which prediction error is reduced. Experiences are negatively valenced when overall prediction error increases and are positively valenced when the sum of prediction errors decrease. We offer an ecological-enactive interpretation of the concept of valence and its connection to rate of change of prediction error. We show how rate of change should be understood in terms of embodied states of affordance-related action readiness. We then go on to apply this ecological-enactive account of error dynamics to provide an answer to the first question we have raised: It may explain why it should feel good to an agent to be curious and playful. Our ecological-enactive account also allows us to show how error dynamics may provide an answer to the second question we have raised regarding how precision-weighting works in active inference. An agent that is sensitive to rates of error reduction can tune precision on the fly. We show how this ability to tune precision on the go can allow agents to develop skills for adapting better and better to the unexpected, and search out opportunities for resolving uncertainty and progressing in its learning.",

      "abstract": "Accurate perceptual inference fundamentally depends upon accurate beliefs about the reliability of sensory data. In this paper, we describe a Bayes optimal and biologically plausible scheme that refines these beliefs through a gradient descent on variational free energy. To illustrate this, we simulate belief updating during visual foraging and show that changes in estimated sensory precision (i.e., confidence in visual data) are highly sensitive to prior beliefs about the contents of a visual scene. In brief, confident prior beliefs induce an increase in estimated precision when consistent with sensory evidence, but a decrease when they conflict. Prior beliefs held with low confidence are rapidly updated to posterior beliefs, determined by sensory data. These induce much smaller changes in beliefs about sensory precision. We argue that pathologies of scene construction may be due to abnormal priors, and show that these can induce a reduction in estimated sensory precision. Having previously associated this precision with cholinergic signaling, we note that several neurodegenerative conditions are associated with visual disturbances and cholinergic deficits; notably, the synucleinopathies. On relating the message passing in our model to the functional anatomy of the ventral visual stream, we find that simulated neuronal loss in temporal lobe regions induces confident, inaccurate, empirical prior beliefs at lower levels in the visual hierarchy. This provides a plausible, if speculative, computational mechanism for the loss of cholinergic signaling and the visual disturbances associated with temporal lobe Lewy body pathology. This may be seen as an illustration of the sorts of hypotheses that may be expressed within this computational framework.",

      "abstract": "To infer the causes of its sensations, the brain must call on a generative (predictive) model. This necessitates passing local messages between populations of neurons to update beliefs about hidden variables in the world beyond its sensory samples. It also entails inferences about how we will act. Active inference is a principled framework that frames perception and action as approximate Bayesian inference. This has been successful in accounting for a wide range of physiological and behavioral phenomena. Recently, a process theory has emerged that attempts to relate inferences to their neurobiological substrates. In this paper, we review and develop the anatomical aspects of this process theory. We argue that the form of the generative models required for inference constrains the way in which brain regions connect to one another. Specifically, neuronal populations representing beliefs about a variable must receive input from populations representing the Markov blanket of that variable. We illustrate this idea in four different domains: perception, planning, attention, and movement. In doing so, we attempt to show how appealing to generative models enables us to account for anatomical brain architectures. Ultimately, committing to an anatomical theory of inference ensures we can form empirical hypotheses that can be tested using neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and electrophysiological experiments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Information gathering comprises actions whose (sensory) consequences resolve uncertainty (i.e., are salient). In other words, actions that solicit salient information cause the greatest shift in beliefs (i.e., information gain) about the causes of our sensations. However, not all information is relevant to the task at hand: this is especially the case in complex, naturalistic scenes. This paper introduces a formal model of selective attention based on active inference and contextual epistemic foraging. We consider a visual search task with a special emphasis on goal-directed and task-relevant exploration. In this scheme, attention modulates the expected fidelity (precision) of the mapping between observations and hidden states in a state-dependent or context-sensitive manner. This ensures task-irrelevant observations have little expected information gain, and so the agent – driven to reduce expected surprise (i.e., uncertainty) – does not actively seek them out. Instead, it selectively samples task-relevant observations, which inform (task-relevant) hidden states. We further show, through simulations, that the atypical exploratory behaviours in conditions such as autism and anxiety may be due to a failure to appropriately modulate sensory precision in a context-specific way.",

While these arguments are certainly of valuable scientific and philosophical merit, they risk underestimating the variety of approaches gathered under the predictive label. Here, we first present a basic review of neuroscientific, cognitive, and philosophical approaches to PP, to illustrate how these range from solidly cognitivist applications-with a firm commitment to modular, internalistic mental representation-to more moderate views emphasizing the importance of 'body-representations', and finally to those which fit comfortably with radically enactive, embodied, and dynamic theories of mind. Any nascent predictive processing theory (e.g., of attention or consciousness) must take into account this continuum of views, and associated theoretical commitments. As a final point, we illustrate how the Free Energy Principle (FEP) attempts to dissolve tension between internalist and externalist accounts of cognition, by providing a formal synthetic account of how internal 'representations' arise from autopoietic self-organization. The FEP thus furnishes empirically productive process theories (e.g., predictive processing) by which to guide discovery through the formal modelling of the embodied mind.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Computational psychiatry is a rapidly emerging field that uses model-based quantities to infer the behavioral and neuronal abnormalities that underlie psychopathology. If successful, this approach promises key insights into (pathological) brain function as well as a more mechanistic and quantitative approach to psychiatric nosology—structuring therapeutic interventions and predicting response and relapse. The basic procedure in computational psychiatry is to build a computational model that formalizes a behavioral or neuronal process. Measured behavioral (or neuronal) responses are then used to infer the model parameters of a single subject or a group of subjects. Here, we provide an illustrative overview over this process, starting from the modeling of choice behavior in a specific task, simulating data, and then inverting that model to estimate group effects. Finally, we illustrate cross-validation to assess whether between-subject variables (e.g., diagnosis) can be recovered successfully. Our worked example uses a simple two-step maze task and a model of choice behavior based on (active) inference and Markov decision processes. The procedural steps and routines we illustrate are not restricted to a specific field of research or particular computational model but can, in principle, be applied in many domains of computational psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We propose a computational neurology of movement based on the convergence of theoretical neurobiology and clinical neurology. A significant development in the former is the idea that we can frame brain function as a process of (active) inference, in which the nervous system makes predictions about its sensory data. These predictions depend upon an implicit predictive (generative) model used by the brain. This means neural dynamics can be framed as generating actions to ensure sensations are consistent with these predictions—and adjusting predictions when they are not. We illustrate the significance of this formulation for clinical neurology by simulating a clinical examination of the motor system using an upper limb coordination task. Specifically, we show how tendon reflexes emerge naturally under the right kind of generative model. Through simulated perturbations, pertaining to prior probabilities of this model’s variables, we illustrate the emergence of hyperreflexia and pendular reflexes, reminiscent of neurological lesions in the corticospinal tract and cerebellum. We then turn to the computational lesions causing hypokinesia and deficits of coordination. This in silico lesion-deficit analysis provides an opportunity to revisit classic neurological dichotomies (e.g. pyramidal versus extrapyramidal systems) from the perspective of modern approaches to theoretical neurobiology—and our understanding of the neurocomputational architecture of movement control based on first principles.",

      "abstract": "This essay addresses Cartesian duality and how its implicit dialectic might be repaired using physics and information theory. Our agenda is to describe a key distinction in the physical sciences that may provide a foundation for the distinction between mind and matter, and between sentient and intentional systems. From this perspective, it becomes tenable to talk about the physics of sentience and 'forces' that underwrite our beliefs (in the sense of probability distributions represented by our internal states), which may ground our mental states and consciousness. We will refer to this view as Markovian monism, which entails two claims: (1) fundamentally, there is only one type of thing and only one type of irreducible property (hence <i>monism</i>). (2) All systems possessing a Markov blanket have properties that are relevant for understanding the mind and consciousness: if such systems have mental properties, then they have them partly by virtue of possessing a Markov blanket (hence <i>Markovian</i>). Markovian monism rests upon the information geometry of random dynamic systems. In brief, the information geometry induced in any system-whose internal states can be distinguished from external states-must acquire a dual aspect. This dual aspect concerns the (intrinsic) information geometry of the probabilistic evolution of internal states and a separate (extrinsic) information geometry of probabilistic beliefs about external states that are parameterised by internal states. We call these intrinsic (i.e., mechanical, or state-based) and extrinsic (i.e., Markovian, or belief-based) information geometries, respectively. Although these mathematical notions may sound complicated, they are fairly straightforward to handle, and may offer a means through which to frame the origins of consciousness.",

In this context, auditory phenomena-known to be especially relevant to studies of PTSD and schizophrenia-and traditional models of auditory function can be viewed from an evolutionary perspective based on active inference. <b>Results:</b> We assess and contextualise a range of evidence on audition, stress, psychosis, and PTSD, and bring some existing partial models of PTSD into multilevel alignment. <b>Conclusions:</b> The novel perspective on PTSD we present aims to serve as a basis for new experimental designs and therapeutic interventions that integrate fundamentally biological, cognitive, behavioural, and environmental factors.",

      "abstract": "Deciding how much evidence to accumulate before making a decision is a problem we and other animals often face, but one that is not completely understood. This issue is particularly important because a tendency to sample less information (often known as reflection impulsivity) is a feature in several psychopathologies, such as psychosis. A formal understanding of information sampling may therefore clarify the computational anatomy of psychopathology. In this theoretical letter, we consider evidence accumulation in terms of active (Bayesian) inference using a generic model of Markov decision processes. Here, agents are equipped with beliefs about their own behavior—in this case, that they will make informed decisions. Normative decision making is then modeled using variational Bayes to minimize surprise about choice outcomes. Under this scheme, different facets of belief updating map naturally onto the functional anatomy of the brain (at least at a heuristic level). Of particular interest is the key role played by the expected precision of beliefs about control, which we have previously suggested may be encoded by dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. We show that manipulating expected precision strongly affects how much information an agent characteristically samples, and thus provides a possible link between impulsivity and dopaminergic dysfunction. Our study therefore represents a step toward understanding evidence accumulation in terms of neurobiologically plausible Bayesian inference and may cast light on why this process is disordered in psychopathology.",

This amounts to the claim that non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics—that underwrite our climate—depend on the Earth system possessing a Markov blanket. Our formalization rests on how the metabolic rates of the biosphere (understood as Markov blanket's internal states) change with respect to solar radiation at the Earth's surface (i.e. external states), through the changes in greenhouse and albedo effects (i.e. active states) and ocean-driven global temperature changes (i.e. sensory states). Describing the interaction between the metabolic rates and solar radiation as climatic states—in a Markov blanket—amounts to describing the dynamics of the internal states as actively inferring external states. This underwrites climatic non-equilibrium steady-state through free energy minimization and thus a form of planetary autopoiesis.",

      "abstract": "The past decades have seen an explosion of studies on empathy in various academic domains including affective neuroscience, psychology, medicine, and economics. However, the volumes of research have almost exclusively focused on its evolutionary origins, development, and neurobiological bases, as well as how the experience of empathy is modulated by social context and interpersonal relationships. In the present paper, we examine a much less attended side of empathy: why it has a positive impact on others? After specifying what the construct of empathy encompasses, we brieﬂy review the various effects of empathy on health outcomes in the domain of medicine. We then propose two non-mutually exclusive mechanistic explanations that contribute to explain the positive effects of physician empathy on patients. (1) The social baseline theory (SBT), building on social support research, proposes that the presence of other people helps individuals to conserve metabolically costly somatic and neural resources through the social regulation of emotion. (2) The free energy principle (FEP) postulates that the brain optimizes a (free energy) bound on surprise or its complement value to respond to environmental changes adaptively. These conceptualizations can be combined to provide a unifying integrative account of the benefits of physicians' empathetic attitude on their patients and how it plays a role in healing beyond the mere effect of the therapeutic alliance.",

A substantial amount of empirical evidence suggests that making sense of another's intentional and belief states (i.e. theory of mind) relies on exteroceptive (e.g. visual and auditory) and proprioceptive (i.e. motor) signals. Yet, despite its pivotal role in the guidance of behaviour, the role of the observer's interoceptive (visceral) processing in understanding another's internal states remains unexplored. Predicting and keeping track of interoceptive bodily states - which inform intentions and beliefs that guide behaviour - is one of the fundamental purposes of the human brain. In this paper, we will focus on the role of interoceptive predictions, prescribed by the free energy principle, in making sense of internal states that cause another's behaviour. We will discuss how multimodal expectations induced at deep (high) hierarchical levels - that necessarily entail interoceptive predictions - contribute to inference about others that is at the heart of theory of mind.",

It has not been well investigated on how to measure depth perception quality independently under different distortion categories and degrees, especially exploit the depth perception to assist the overall quality assessment of 3D videos. In this paper, we propose a new depth perception quality metric (DPQM) and verify that it outperforms existing metrics on our published 3D video extension of High Efficiency Video Coding (3D-HEVC) video database. Furthermore, we validate its effectiveness by applying the crucial part of the DPQM to a novel blind stereoscopic video quality evaluator (BSVQE) for overall 3D video quality assessment. In the DPQM, we introduce the feature of auto-regressive prediction-based disparity entropy (ARDE) measurement and the feature of energy weighted video content measurement, which are inspired by the free-energy principle and the binocular vision mechanism. In the BSVQE, the binocular summation and difference operations are integrated together with the fusion natural scene statistic measurement and the ARDE measurement to reveal the key influence from texture and disparity. Experimental results on three stereoscopic video databases demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art SVQA algorithms for both symmetrically and asymmetrically distorted stereoscopic video pairs of various distortion types.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Motivation: Several results in the literature suggest that biologically interesting RNAs have secondary structures that are more stable than expected by chance. Based on these observations, we developed a scanning algorithm for detecting noncoding RNA genes in genome sequences, using a fully probabilistic version of the Zuker minimum-energy folding algorithm. Results: Preliminary results were encouraging, but certain anomalies led us to do a carefully controlled investigation of this class of methods. Ultimately, our results argue that for the probabilistic model there is indeed a statistical effect, but it comes mostly from local base-composition bias and not from RNA secondary structure. For the thermodynamic implementation (which evaluates statistical significance by doing Monte Carlo shuffling in fixed-length sequence windows, thus eliminating the base-composition effect) the signals for noncoding RNAs are still usually indistinguishable from noise, especially when certain statistical artifacts resulting from local base-composition inhomogeneity are taken into account. We conclude that although a distinct, stable secondary structure is undoubtedly important in most noncoding RNAs, the stability of most noncoding RNA secondary structures is not sufficiently different from the predicted stability of a random sequence to be useful as a general genefinding approach.

      "abstract": "In the past few decades, probabilistic interpretations of brain functions have become widespread in cognitive science and neuroscience. In particular, the free energy principle and active inference are increasingly popular theories of cognitive functions that claim to offer a unified understanding of life and cognition within a general mathematical framework derived from information and control theory, and statistical mechanics. However, we argue that if the active inference proposal is to be taken as a general process theory for biological systems, it is necessary to understand how it relates to existing control theoretical approaches routinely used to study and explain biological systems. For example, recently, PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control has been shown to be implemented in simple molecular systems and is becoming a popular mechanistic explanation of behaviours such as chemotaxis in bacteria and amoebae, and robust adaptation in biochemical networks. In this work, we will show how PID controllers can fit a more general theory of life and cognition under the principle of (variational) free energy minimisation when using approximate linear generative models of the world. This more general interpretation also provides a new perspective on traditional problems of PID controllers such as parameter tuning as well as the need to balance performances and robustness conditions of a controller. Specifically, we then show how these problems can be understood in terms of the optimisation of the precisions (inverse variances) modulating different prediction errors in the free energy functional.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The notions of degeneracy and redundancy are important constructs in many areas, ranging from genomics through to network science. Degeneracy finds a powerful role in neuroscience, explaining key aspects of distributed processing and structure–function relationships in the brain. For example, degeneracy accounts for the superadditive effect of lesions on functional deficits in terms of a “many-to-one” structure–function mapping. In this paper, we offer a principled account of degeneracy and redundancy, when function is operationalized in terms of active inference, namely, a formulation of perception and action as belief updating under generative models of the world. In brief, “degeneracy” is quantified by the “entropy” of posterior beliefs about the causes of sensations, while “redundancy” is the “complexity” cost incurred by forming those beliefs. From this perspective, degeneracy and redundancy are complementary: Active inference tries to minimize redundancy while maintaining degeneracy. This formulation is substantiated using statistical and mathematical notions of degenerate mappings and statistical efficiency. We then illustrate changes in degeneracy and redundancy during the learning of a word repetition task. Finally, we characterize the effects of lesions—to intrinsic and extrinsic connections—using in silico disconnections. These numerical analyses highlight the fundamental difference between degeneracy and redundancy—and how they score distinct imperatives for perceptual inference and structure learning that are relevant to synthetic and biological intelligence.",

To address this gap in the research, we used an immersive virtual-reality racquetball paradigm to explore how visual sampling behaviours and movement kinematics are adjusted in relation to unexpected, uncertain, and volatile changes in environmental statistics. We found that prior expectations concerning ball ‘bounciness’ affected sensorimotor control in both autistic and neurotypical participants, with all individuals using prediction-driven gaze strategies to track the virtual ball. However, autistic participants showed substantial differences in visuomotor behaviour when environmental conditions were more volatile. Specifically, uncertainty-related performance difficulties in these conditions were accompanied by atypical movement kinematics and visual sampling responses. Results support proposals that autistic people overestimate the volatility of sensory environments, and suggest that context-sensitive differences in active inference could explain a range of movement-related difficulties in autism.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Active inference offers a unified theory of perception, learning, and decision-making at computational and neural levels of description. In this article, we address the worry that active inference may be in tension with the belief–desire–intention (BDI) model within folk psychology because it does not include terms for desires (or other conative constructs) at the mathematical level of description. To resolve this concern, we first provide a brief review of the historical progression from predictive coding to active inference, enabling us to distinguish between active inference formulations of motor control (which need not have desires under folk psychology) and active inference formulations of decision processes (which do have desires within folk psychology). We then show that, despite a superficial tension when viewed at the mathematical level of description, the active inference formalism contains terms that are readily identifiable as encoding both the objects of desire and the strength of desire at the psychological level of description. We demonstrate this with simple simulations of an active inference agent motivated to leave a dark room for different reasons. Despite their consistency, we further show how active inference may increase the granularity of folk-psychological descriptions by highlighting distinctions between drives to seek information versus reward—and how it may also offer more precise, quantitative folk-psychological predictions. Finally, we consider how the implicitly conative components of active inference may have partial analogues (i.e., “as if” desires) in other systems describable by the broader free energy principle to which it conforms.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Imbalances in approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) decision-making (e.g., sacrificing rewards to avoid negative outcomes) are considered central to multiple psychiatric disorders. We used computational modelling to examine 2 factors that are often not distinguished in descriptive analyses of AAC: decision uncertainty and sensitivity to negative outcomes versus rewards (emotional conflict).<h4>Methods</h4>A previously validated AAC task was completed by 478 participants, including healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 59), people with substance use disorders (<i>n</i> = 159) and people with depression and/or anxiety disorders who did not have substance use disorders (<i>n</i> = 260). Using an active inference model, we estimated individual-level values for a model parameter that reflected decision uncertainty and another that reflected emotional conflict. We also repeated analyses in a subsample (59 healthy controls, 161 people with depression and/or anxiety disorders, 56 people with substance use disorders) that was propensity-matched for age and general intelligence.<h4>Results</h4>The model showed high accuracy (72%). As further validation, parameters correlated with reaction times and self-reported task motivations in expected directions. The emotional conflict parameter further correlated with self-reported anxiety during the task (<i>r</i> = 0.32, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and the decision uncertainty parameter correlated with self-reported difficulty making decisions (<i>r</i> = 0.45, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Compared to healthy controls, people with depression and/or anxiety disorders and people with substance use disorders showed higher decision uncertainty in the propensity-matched sample (<i>t</i> = 2.16, <i>p</i> = 0.03, and <i>t</i> = 2.88, <i>p</i> = 0.005, respectively), with analogous results in the full sample; people with substance use disorders also showed lower emotional conflict in the full sample (<i>t</i> = 3.17, <i>p</i> = 0.002).<h4>Limitations</h4>This study was limited by heterogeneity of the clinical sample and an inability to examine learning.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results suggest that reduced confidence in how to act, rather than increased emotional conflict, may explain maladaptive approach-avoidance behaviours in people with psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "In order to interact seamlessly with robots, users must infer the causes of a robot’s behavior–and be confident about that inference (and its predictions). Hence, trust is a necessary condition for human-robot collaboration (HRC). However, and despite its crucial role, it is still largely unknown how trust emerges, develops, and supports human relationship to technological systems. In the following paper we review the literature on trust, human-robot interaction, HRC, and human interaction at large. Early models of trust suggest that it is a trade-off between benevolence and competence; while studies of human to human interaction emphasize the role of shared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We go on to introduce a model of trust as an agent’ best explanation for reliable sensory exchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the cognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of HRC, trust can be casted in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. Interactive feedback is a necessary condition to the extension of the trustor’s perception-action cycle. This model has important implications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration–as it allows the traditional determinants of human trust, such as the benevolence and competence attributed to the trustee, to be defined in terms of hierarchical active inference, while vulnerability can be described in terms of information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model emphasizes the role of user feedback during HRC and suggests that boredom and surprise may be used in personalized interactions as markers for under and over-reliance on the system. The description of trust as a sense of virtual control offers a crucial step toward grounding human factors in cognitive neuroscience and improving the design of human-centered technology. Furthermore, we examine the role of shared behavior in the genesis of trust, especially in the context of dyadic collaboration, suggesting important consequences for the acceptability and design of human-robot collaborative systems.",

      "abstract": "Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are often distressing symptoms of several neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia. Using a Markov decision process formulation of active inference, we develop a novel model of AVH as false (positive) inference. Active inference treats perception as a process of hypothesis testing, in which sensory data are used to disambiguate between alternative hypotheses about the world. Crucially, this depends upon a delicate balance between prior beliefs about unobserved (hidden) variables and the sensations they cause. A false inference that a voice is present, even in the absence of auditory sensations, suggests that prior beliefs dominate perceptual inference. Here we consider the computational mechanisms that could cause this imbalance in perception. Through simulation, we show that the content of (and confidence in) prior beliefs depends on beliefs about policies (here sequences of listening and talking) and on beliefs about the reliability of sensory data. We demonstrate several ways in which hallucinatory percepts could occur when an agent expects to hear a voice in the presence of imprecise sensory data. This model expresses, in formal terms, alternative computational mechanisms that underwrite AVH and, speculatively, can be mapped onto neurobiological changes associated with schizophrenia. The interaction of action and perception is important in modeling AVH, given that speech is a fundamentally enactive and interactive process-and that hallucinators often actively engage with their voices.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The prefrontal cortex is vital for a range of cognitive processes, including working memory, attention, and decision-making. Notably, its absence impairs the performance of tasks requiring the maintenance of information through a delay period. In this paper, we formulate a rodent task—which requires maintenance of delay-period activity—as a Markov decision process and treat optimal task performance as an (active) inference problem. We simulate the behavior of a Bayes optimal mouse presented with 1 of 2 cues that instructs the selection of concurrent visual and auditory targets on a trial-by-trial basis. Formulating inference as message passing, we reproduce features of neuronal coupling within and between prefrontal regions engaged by this task. We focus on the micro-circuitry that underwrites delay-period activity and relate it to functional specialization within the prefrontal cortex in primates. Finally, we simulate the electrophysiological correlates of inference and demonstrate the consequences of lesions to each part of our in silico prefrontal cortex. In brief, this formulation suggests that recurrent excitatory connections—which support persistent neuronal activity—encode beliefs about transition probabilities over time. We argue that attentional modulation can be understood as the contextualization of sensory input by these persistent beliefs.",

      "abstract": "Balancing habitual and deliberate forms of choice entails a comparison of their respective merits—the former being faster but inflexible, and the latter slower but more versatile. Here, we show that arbitration between these two forms of control can be derived from first principles within an Active Inference scheme. We illustrate our arguments with simulations that reproduce rodent spatial decisions in T-mazes. In this context, deliberation has been associated with vicarious trial and error (VTE) behavior (i.e., the fact that rodents sometimes stop at decision points as if deliberating between choice alternatives), whose neurophysiological correlates are “forward sweeps” of hippocampal place cells in the arms of the maze under consideration. Crucially, forward sweeps arise early in learning and disappear shortly after, marking a transition from deliberative to habitual choice. Our simulations show that this transition emerges as the optimal solution to the trade-off between policies that maximize reward or extrinsic value (habitual policies) and those that also consider the epistemic value of exploratory behavior (deliberative or epistemic policies)—the latter requiring VTE and the retrieval of episodic information via forward sweeps. We thus offer a novel perspective on the optimality principles that engender forward sweeps and VTE, and on their role on deliberate choice.",

      "abstract": "In 1895 in the Project for a Scientific Psychology, Freud tried to integrate psychology and neurology in order to develop a neuroscientific psychology. Since 1880, Freud made no distinction between psychology and physiology. His papers from the end of the 1880s to 1890 were very clear on this scientific overlap: as with many of his contemporaries, Freud thought about psychology essentially as the physiology of the brain. Years later he had to surrender, realizing a technological delay, not capable of pursuing its ambitious aim, and until that moment psychoanalysis would have to use its more suitable clinical method. Also, he seemed skeptical about phrenology drift, typical of that time, in which any psychological function needed to be located in its neuroanatomical area. He could not see the progresses of neuroscience and its fruitful dialogue with psychoanalysis, which occurred also thanks to the improvements in the field of neuroimaging, which has made possible a remarkable advance in the knowledge of the mind-brain system and a better observation of the psychoanalytical theories. After years of investigations, deriving from research and clinical work of the last century, the discovery of neural networks, together with the free energy principle, we are observing under a new light psychodynamic neuroscience in its exploration of the mind-brain system. In this manuscript, we summarize the important developments of psychodynamic neuroscience, with particular regard to the free energy principle, the resting state networks, especially the Default Mode Network in its link with the Self, emphasizing our view of a bridge between psychoanalysis and neuroscience. Finally, we suggest a discussion by approaching the concept of Alpha Function, proposed by the psychoanalyst Wilfred Ruprecht Bion, continuing the association with neuroscience.",

The tension is traced to the importance, in free energy formulations, of a conception of mind and agency that depends upon the presence of a ‘Markov blanket’ Andrey Markov demarcating the agent from the surrounding world. In what follows I show that the Markov blanket considerations do not, in fact, lead to the kinds of tension that Howhy depicts. On the contrary, they actively favour the EEE story. This is because the Markov property, as exemplified in biological agents, picks out neither a unique nor a stationary boundary. It is this multiplicity and mutability– rather than the absence of agent-environment boundaries as such - that EEE cognition celebrates.",

      "abstract": "The field of motor control has long focused on the achievement of external goals through action (e.g., reaching and grasping objects). However, recent studies in conditions of multisensory conflict, such as when a subject experiences the rubber hand illusion or embodies an avatar in virtual reality, reveal the presence of unconscious movements that are not goal-directed, but rather aim at resolving multisensory conflicts; for example, by aligning the position of a person’s arm with that of an embodied avatar. This second, conflict-resolution imperative of movement control did not emerge in classical studies of motor adaptation and online corrections, which did not allow movements to reduce the conflicts; and has been largely ignored so far in formal theories. Here, we propose a model of movement control grounded in the theory of active inference that integrates intentional and conflict-resolution imperatives. We present three simulations showing that the active inference model is able to characterize movements guided by the intention to achieve an external goal, by the necessity to resolve multisensory conflict, or both. Furthermore, our simulations reveal a fundamental difference between the (active) inference underlying intentional and conflict-resolution imperatives by showing that it is driven by two different (model and sensory) kinds of prediction errors. Finally, our simulations show that when movement is only guided by conflict resolution, the model incorrectly infers that is velocity is zero, as if it was not moving. This result suggests a novel speculative explanation for the fact that people are unaware of their subtle compensatory movements to avoid multisensory conflict. Furthermore, it can potentially help shed light on deficits of motor awareness that arise in psychopathological conditions.",

This article argues that mineness is produced by processes of interoceptive active inference that model the self as the underlying cause of continuity and coherence in affective experience. A key component of this hierarchical processing system and hub of affective self-modeling is activity in the anterior insula cortex. I defend the account by applying it to the phenomenon of pain asymbolia, a condition in which nociceptive signals (of bodily damage) are not attributed to the self. Thus, pain asymbolia is a form of \"depersonalization for pain\" as Klein puts it. The pain is experienced as happening to <i>my body</i> but is not experienced as <i>mine</i>. Thus, we can describe it as loss of subjective presence or \"mineness\" for the experience of pain.",

We argue that recent work on the free energy principle supports the following claims with respect to the life-mind continuity thesis: (i) there is a strong continuity between life and mind; (ii) all living systems can be described as if they had representational states; (iii) the ’as-if representationality’ entailed by the free energy principle is central to understanding both basic forms of intentionality and intentionality in non-basic minds. In addition to this, we argue that the free energy principle also renders realism about computation and representation compatible with a strong life-mind continuity thesis (although the free energy principle does not entail computational and representational realism). In particular, we show how representationality proper can be grounded in ’as-if representationality’.",

      "abstract": "According to the free energy principle all living systems aim to minimise free energy in their sensory exchanges with the environment. Processes of free energy minimisation are thus ubiquitous in the biological world. Indeed it has been argued that even plants engage in free energy minimisation. Not all living things however feel alive. How then did the feeling of being alive get started? In line with the arguments of the phenomenologists, I will claim that every feeling must be felt by someone. It must have mineness built into it if it is to feel a particular way. The question I take up in this paper asks how mineness might have arisen out of processes of free energy minimisation, given that many systems that keep themselves alive lack mineness. The hypothesis I develop in this paper is that the life of an organism can be seen as an inferential process. Every living system embodies a probability distribution conditioned on a model of the sensory, physiological, and morphological states that are highly probably given the life it leads and the niche it inhabits. I argue for an ecological and enactive interpretation of free energy. I show how once the life of an organism reaches a certain level of complexity mineness emerges as an intrinsic part of the process of life itself.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the foundations for a Gibsonian neuroscience. There is an increasingly influential current in neuroscience based on pragmatic and selectionist principles, which we think can contribute to ecological psychology. Starting from ecological psychology, we identify three basic constraints any Gibsonian neuroscience needs to adhere to: nonreconstructive perception, vicarious functioning, and selectionist self-organization. We discuss two previous attempts to integrate affordances with neuroscience: Reed’s ecological rendering of Edelman’s selectionism as well as Dreyfus’ phenomenological interpretation of Freeman’s neurodynamics. Reed and Dreyfus face the problem of how to account for “value.” We then show how the free-energy principle, an increasingly dominant framework in theoretical neuroscience, is rooted in both Freeman’s neurodynamics and Edelman’s selectionism. The free-energy principle accounts for value in terms of selective anticipation. The selection pressures at work on the agent shape its selective sensitivity to the relevant affordances in the environment. By being responsive to the relevant affordances in the environment, an agent comes to have grip on its interactions with the environment and can thrive in its ecological niche.",

      "abstract": "A popular distinction in the human and animal learning literature is between deliberate (or willed) and habitual (or automatic) modes of control. Extensive evidence indicates that, after sufficient learning, living organisms develop behavioural habits that permit them saving computational resources. Furthermore, humans and other animals are able to transfer control from deliberate to habitual modes (and vice versa), trading off efficiently flexibility and parsimony - an ability that is currently unparalleled by artificial control systems. Here, we discuss a computational implementation of habit formation, and the transfer of control from deliberate to habitual modes (and vice versa) within Active Inference: a computational framework that merges aspects of cybernetic theory and of Bayesian inference. To model habit formation, we endow an Active Inference agent with a mechanism to \"cache\" (or memorize) policy probabilities from previous trials, and reuse them to skip - in part or in full - the inferential steps of deliberative processing. We exploit the fact that the relative quality of policies, conditioned upon hidden states, is constant over trials; provided that contingencies and prior preferences do not change. This means the only quantity that can change policy selection is the prior distribution over the initial state - where this prior is based upon the posterior beliefs from previous trials. Thus, an agent that caches the quality (or the probability) of policies can safely reuse cached values to save on cognitive and computational resources - unless contingencies change. Our simulations illustrate the computational benefits, but also the limits, of three caching schemes under Active Inference. They suggest that key aspects of habitual behaviour - such as perseveration - can be explained in terms of caching policy probabilities. Furthermore, they suggest that there may be many kinds (or stages) of habitual behaviour, each associated with a different caching scheme; for example, caching associated or not associated with contextual estimation. These schemes are more or less impervious to contextual and contingency changes.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a leading theory in neuroscience that provides a simple and neuro-biologically plausible account of how action and perception are coupled in producing (Bayes) optimal behavior; and has been recently used to explain a variety of psychopathological conditions. In parallel, morphogenesis has been described as the behavior of a (non-neural) cellular collective intelligence solving problems in anatomical morphospace. In this article, we establish a link between the domains of cell biology and neuroscience, by analyzing disorders of morphogenesis as disorders of (active) inference. The aim of this article is three-fold. We want to: (i) reveal a connection between disorders of morphogenesis and disorders of active inference as apparent in psychopathological conditions; (ii) show how disorders of morphogenesis can be simulated using active inference; (iii) suggest that active inference can shed light on developmental defects or aberrant morphogenetic processes, seen as disorders of information processing, and perhaps suggesting novel intervention and repair strategies. We present four simulations illustrating application of these ideas to cellular behavior during morphogenesis. Three of the simulations show that the same forms of aberrant active inference (e.g., deficits of sensory attenuation and low sensory precision) that have been used to explain psychopathological conditions (e.g., schizophrenia and autism) also produce familiar disorders of development and morphogenesis when implemented at the level of the collective behavior of a group of cells. The fourth simulation involves two cells with too high precision, in which we show that the reduction of concentration signaling and sensitivity to the signals of other cells treats the development defect. Finally, we present the results of an experimental test of one of the model's predictions in early Xenopus laevis embryos: thioridazine (a dopamine antagonist that may reduce sensory precision in biological systems) induced developmental (anatomical) defects as predicted. The use of conceptual and empirical tools from neuroscience to understand the morphogenetic behavior of pre-neural agents offers the possibility of new approaches in regenerative medicine and evolutionary developmental biology.",

      "abstract": "Understanding and promoting subjective wellbeing (SWB) has been the topic of increasing research, due in part to its potential contributions to health and productivity. To date, the conceptualization of SWB has been grounded within social psychology and largely focused on self-report measures. In this paper, we explore the potentially complementary tools and theoretical perspectives offered by computational neuroscience, with a focus on the active inference (AI) framework. This framework is motivated by the fact that the brain does not have direct access to the world; to select actions, it must instead infer the most likely external causes of the sensory input it receives from both the body and the external world. Because sensory input is always consistent with multiple interpretations, the brain’s internal model must use background knowledge, in the form of prior expectations, to make a “best guess” about the situation it is in and how it will change by taking one action or another. This best guess arises by minimizing an error signal representing the deviation between predicted and observed sensations given a chosen action—quantified mathematically by a variable called free energy (FE). Crucially, recent proposals have illustrated how emotional experience may emerge within AI as a natural consequence of the brain keeping track of the success of its model in selecting actions to minimize FE. In this paper, we draw on the concepts and mathematics in AI to highlight how different computational strategies can be used to minimize FE—some more successfully than others. This affords a characterization of how diverse individuals may adopt unique strategies for achieving high SWB. It also highlights novel ways in which SWB could be effectively improved. These considerations lead us to propose a novel computational framework for understanding SWB. We highlight several parameters in these models that could explain individual and cultural differences in SWB, and how they might inspire novel interventions. We conclude by proposing a line of future empirical research based on computational modelling that could complement current approaches to the study of wellbeing and its improvement.",

Drawing on Thomas Nagel's seminal inquiry into subjective experience and Husserlian phenomenology, we propose that phenomenological \"What is it like?\" questions can be integrated with neuroscientific models through predictive error coding (PEC). PEC reconceptualizes the brain as an active inference system, continuously generating and updating predictions about sensory inputs. We introduce the concept of \"query acts\" to describe the brain's interrogative engagement with sensory information, linking intentionality in phenomenology with predictive mechanisms in neuroscience. By framing qualia as dynamic processes arising from query acts rather than static entities, we bridge the explanatory gap between subjective experience and objective inquiry. This interdisciplinary framework highlights structural parallels between noetic processes in phenomenology and PEC in neuroscience, providing a novel perspective on the emergence of conscious experience. Additionally, we explore the implications of query acts for clinical interventions in psychiatric disorders and the development of context-sensitive artificial intelligence systems. This synthesis fosters deeper integration of philosophical and scientific approaches to understanding the nature of consciousness.",

Stuttering is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by speech disfluencies such as repetitions, prolongations, and blocks. The principles of active inference, a theory of predictive processing and sentient behavior, can be used to conceptualize stuttering as a disruption in perception-action cycling underlying speech production. The theory proposed here posits that stuttering arises from aberrant sensory precision and prediction error dynamics, inhibiting syllable initiation. Relevant to this theory, two hypothesized mechanisms are proposed: (1) a mistiming in precision dynamics, and (2) excessive attentional focus. Both highlight the role of neural oscillations, prediction error, and hierarchical integration in speech production. This framework also explains the contextual variability of stuttering behaviors, including adaptation effects and fluency-inducing conditions. Reframing stuttering as a synaptopathy integrates neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral dimensions, suggesting disruptions in precision-weighting mediated by neuromodulatory systems. This active inference perspective provides a unified account of stuttering and sets the stage for innovative research and therapeutic approaches.",

However, our current understanding of proprioceptive processing at the laminar scale is limited. Empirical findings in primates and rodents suggest a pronounced role of superficial cortical layers, but the involvement of deep layers has yet to be examined in humans. Submillimeter resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged in recent years, paving the way for studying layer-dependent activity in humans (laminar fMRI). In the present study, laminar fMRI was employed to investigate the influence of proprioceptive somatosensation on M1 deep layer activation using passive finger movements. Significant M1 deep layer activation was observed in response to proprioceptive stimulation across 10 healthy subjects using a vascular space occupancy (VASO)-sequence at 7 T. For further validation, two additional datasets were included which were obtained using a balanced steady-state free precession sequence with ultrahigh (0.3 mm) in-plane resolution, yielding converging results. These results were interpreted in the light of previous laminar fMRI studies and the active inference account of motor control. We propose that a considerable proportion of M1 deep layer activation is due to proprioceptive influence and that deep layers of M1 constitute a key component in proprioceptive circuits.",

These systems are characterised by an environment, such as a home or classroom, infused with multiple, highly networked streams of smart technology working in the background, learning about the user and operating without an explicit interface or any intentional sensorimotor engagement from the user. We analyse these systems in the context of work on the \"classical\" extended mind, characterised by conditions such as \"trust and glue\" and phenomenal transparency, and find that these conditions are ill-suited to describing our engagement with ambient smart environments. We then draw from the active inference framework, a theory of brain function which casts cognition as a process of embodied uncertainty minimisation, to develop a version of the extended mind grounded in a process ontology, where the boundaries of mind are understood to be multiple and always shifting. Given this more fluid account of the extended mind, we argue that ambient smart environments should be thought of as extended allostatic control systems, operating more or less invisibly to support an agent's biological capacity for minimising uncertainty over multiple, interlocking timescales. Thus, we account for the functionality of ambient smart environments as extended systems, and in so doing, utilise a markedly different version of the classical thesis of extended mind.",

Here we lay the groundwork for future research on optimism as an intervention by introducing a domain general formal model of optimism bias, which can be applied in different task settings. Employing the active inference framework, we propose a model of the optimism bias as high precision likelihood biased towards positive outcomes. First, we simulate how optimism may be lost during development by exposure to negative events. We then ground our model in the empirical literature by showing how the developmentally acquired differences in optimism are expressed in a belief updating task typically used to assess optimism bias. Finally, we show how optimism affects action in a modified two-armed bandit task. Our model and the simulations it affords provide a computational basis for understanding how optimism bias may emerge, how it may be expressed in standard tasks used to assess optimism, and how it affects agents' decision-making and actions; in combination, this provides a basis for future research on optimism as a mental health intervention.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate whether expectancy, induced through a placebo procedure, favors the activation of the corticospinal tract before movement initiation. By adopting the premovement facilitation paradigm, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation over the left or right primary motor cortex at rest and 100 ms or 50 ms before movement onset while healthy volunteers performed a reaction time (RT) motor task consisting of abductions of the right or left thumb after a go signal. Participants in the placebo group received an inert electrical device applied on the right forearm along with information on its speed-enhancing properties. A control group received the same device with overt information about its inert nature, while another control group underwent no intervention. Along with RT, we measured the amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP) before and after the procedure. Compared to the control groups, the placebo group had faster RT and greater MEP amplitude before movement initiation. This study demonstrates that the placebo effect can boost the activity of the corticospinal tract before movement onset, and this modulation positively impacts motor performance. These results give experimental support to the active inference account.",

Flow and intuition represent two cognitive phenomena rooted in nonconscious information processing; however, there are clear differences in both their phenomenal characteristics and, more broadly, their contribution to action and cognition. We propose, extrapolating from dual processing theory, that intuition serves as a rapid, nonconscious decision-making process, while flow facilitates this process in action, achieving optimal cognitive control and performance without [conscious] deliberation. By exploring these points of convergence between flow and intuition, we also attempt to reconcile the apparent paradox of the presence of enhanced intuition in flow, which is also a state of heightened cognitive control. To do so, we utilize a revised dual-processing framework, which allows us to productively align and differentiate flow and intuition (including intuition in flow). Furthermore, we draw on recent work examining flow from an active inference perspective. Our account not only heightens understanding of human cognition and consciousness, but also raises new questions for future research, aiming to deepen our comprehension of how flow and intuition can be harnessed to elevate human performance and wellbeing.",

Real-time manipulations of auditory feedback were used to drive sensorimotor adaptation in speech, while participants spoke sentences in synchrony with another voice, a task known to induce implicit imitation (phonetic convergence). The acoustic-phonetic properties of the other voice were manipulated between groups, such that convergence with it would either oppose (incongruent group, n = 15) or align with (congruent group, n = 16) speech motor adaptation. As predicted, significantly greater adaptation was seen in the congruent compared to the incongruent group. This suggests the use of shared sensory targets in speech for predicting the sensory outcomes of both the actions of others (speech perception) and the actions of the self (speech production). This finding has important implications for wider theories of shared predictive mechanisms across perception and action, such as active inference.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Predictive processing approaches to brain function are increasingly delivering promise for illuminating the computational underpinnings of a wide range of phenomenological states. It remains unclear, however, whether predictive processing is equipped to accommodate a theory of consciousness itself. Furthermore, objectors have argued that without specification of the core computational mechanisms of consciousness, predictive processing is unable to inform the attribution of consciousness to other non-human (biological and artificial) systems. In this paper, I argue that an account of consciousness in the predictive brain is within reach via recent accounts of phenomenal self-modelling in the active inference framework. The central claim here is that phenomenal consciousness is underpinned by ‘subjective valuation’—a deep inference about the precision or ‘predictability’ of the self-evidencing (‘fitness-promoting’) outcomes of action. Based on this account, I argue that this approach can critically inform the distribution of experience in other systems, paying particular attention to the complex sensory attenuation mechanisms associated with deep self-models. I then consider an objection to the account: several recent papers argue that theories of consciousness that invoke self-consciousness as constitutive or necessary for consciousness are undermined by states (or traits) of ‘selflessness’; in particular the ‘totally selfless’ states of ego-dissolution occasioned by psychedelic drugs. Drawing on existing work that accounts for psychedelic-induced ego-dissolution in the active inference framework, I argue that these states do not threaten to undermine an active inference theory of consciousness. Instead, these accounts corroborate the view that subjective valuation is the constitutive facet of experience, and they highlight the potential of psychedelic research to inform consciousness science, computational psychiatry and computational phenomenology.",

Some have argued that this necessitates augmenting machine intelligence with understanding such that, when queried, a machine is able to explain its behaviour (i.e., explainable AI). In this article, we address the issue of machine understanding from the perspective of active inference. This paradigm enables decision making based upon a model of how data are generated. The generative model contains those variables required to explain sensory data, and its inversion may be seen as an attempt to explain the causes of these data. Here we are interested in explanations of one’s own actions. This implies a deep generative model that includes a model of the world, used to infer policies, and a higher-level model that attempts to predict which policies will be selected based upon a space of hypothetical (i.e., counterfactual) explanations—and which can subsequently be used to provide (retrospective) explanations about the policies pursued. We illustrate the construct validity of this notion of understanding in relation to human understanding by highlighting the similarities in computational architecture and the consequences of its dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Active inference integrates perception, decision-making, and learning into a united theoretical framework, providing an efficient way to trade off exploration and exploitation by minimizing (expected) free energy. In this study, we asked how the brain represents values and uncertainties (novelty and variability), and resolves these uncertainties under the active inference framework in the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Twenty-five participants performed a contextual two-armed bandit task, with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. By comparing the model evidence for active inference and reinforcement learning models of choice behavior, we show that active inference better explains human decision-making under novelty and variability, which entails exploration or information seeking. The EEG sensor-level results show that the activity in the frontal, central, and parietal regions is associated with novelty, while the activity in the frontal and central brain regions is associated with variability. The EEG source-level results indicate that the expected free energy is encoded in the frontal pole and middle frontal gyrus and uncertainties are encoded in different brain regions but with overlap. Our study dissociates the expected free energy and uncertainties in active inference theory and their neural correlates, speaking to the construct validity of active inference in characterizing cognitive processes of human decisions. It provides behavioral and neural evidence of active inference in decision processes and insights into the neural mechanism of human decisions under uncertainties.",

      "abstract": "This record contains the preprint \"A Geometric Free-Energy Framework for Pragmatic Neural Population Codes\" by Ryotaro Saito (2025). Biological systems must act and communicate under pervasive uncertainty. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and active inference describe such systems as minimising variational and expected free energy, but it remains unclear how this view constrains pragmatic communication and concrete neural population codes. This work develops a geometric framework that links an expected free energy (EFE)–based control objective, probabilistic speaker–listener models from pragmatic language theory, and information-theoretic measures of communication quality that can be evaluated on large-scale neural data. On the \"speaker\" side, the paper posits a message-level EFE G(u; w, c) for triples of message u, world state w, and context c, and shows how an EFE-based softmax over messages induces a pragmatic speaker compatible with Rational Speech Act–style models. A behaviour-preserving reparameterisation separates pure generative semantics, normalisation-adjusted production cost, and expected information gain, clarifying which components are in principle identifiable from behaviour. On the \"listener\" side, neural population responses are embedded into a latent metric space equipped with a Gaussian prototype geometry. An ideal listener combines latent likelihoods with task priors via Bayes’ rule, while actual listeners are implemented as logistic decoders on the same latent codes. From their posteriors, the paper derives two unitful diagnostics: a single-trial information gain and a KL-based pragmatic loss that quantify, in nats, how effectively a given listener exploits information encoded in a sender population. The framework is instantiated on Neuropixels recordings from the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) visual decision-making task. Across 13 probe insertions (8,476 trials, 2,344 neurons), the latent geometry supports robust ideal decoding, whereas logistic listeners systematically underuse available information. A four-pattern decomposition of pragmatic loss disentangles contributions from task priors, latent geometry, and decoder class, showing that much of the apparent loss under biased priors is attributable to deliberately withholding block priors from the main decoder. Although the empirical application focuses on cortical spike trains and a binary decision task, the construction is substrate-agnostic: wherever world states, contexts, messages, and an appropriate geometric representation can be defined, the same pair of metrics (information gain and pragmatic loss) can be used to quantify communication quality under uncertainty.

      "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the active inference framework as a means to enable autonomous behavior in artificial agents. Active inference is a theoretical framework underpinning the way organisms act and observe in the real world. In active inference, agents act in order to minimize their so called free energy, or prediction error. Besides being biologically plausible, active inference has been shown to solve hard exploration problems in various simulated environments. However, these simulations typically require handcrafting a generative model for the agent. Therefore we propose to use recent advances in deep artificial neural networks to learn generative state space models from scratch, using only observation-action sequences. This way we are able to scale active inference to new and challenging problem domains, whilst still building on the theoretical backing of the free energy principle. We validate our approach on the mountain car problem to illustrate that our learnt models can indeed trade-off instrumental value and ambiguity. Furthermore, we show that generative models can also be learnt using high-dimensional pixel observations, both in the OpenAI Gym car racing environment and a real-world robotic navigation task. Finally we show that active inference based policies are an order of magnitude more sample efficient than Deep Q Networks on RL tasks.",

While some social cognition theories seemingly take an enactive perspective on social cognition, they explain it as the attribution of mental states to other people, by assuming representational structures, in line with the classic Theory of Mind (ToM). Holding both enactivism and ToM, we argue, entails contradiction and confusion due to two ToM assumptions widely known to be rejected by enactivism: that (1) social cognition reduces to mental representation and (2) social cognition is a hardwired contentful ‘toolkit’ or ‘starter pack’ that fuels the model-like theorising supposed in (1). The paper offers a positive alternative, one that avoids contradictions or confusion. After rejecting ToM-inspired theories of social cognition and clarifying the profile of social cognition under enactivism, that is without assumptions (1) and (2), the last section advances an enactivist-dynamic model of cognition as dynamic, real-time, fluid, contextual social action, where we use the formalisms of dynamical systems theory to explain the origins of socio-cognitive novelty in developmental change and active inference as a tool to demonstrate social understanding as generalised synchronisation.",

      "abstract": "Hallucinations, including auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), occur in both the healthy population and in psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia (often developing after a prodromal period). In addition, hallucinations can be in-context (they can be consistent with the environment, such as when one hallucinates the end of a sentence that has been repeated many times), or out-of-context (such as the bizarre hallucinations associated with schizophrenia). In previous work, we introduced a model of hallucinations as false (positive) inferences based on a (Markov decision process) formulation of active inference. In this work, we extend this model to include content-to disclose the computational mechanisms behind in- and out-of-context hallucinations. In active inference, sensory information is used to disambiguate alternative hypotheses about the causes of sensations. Sensory information is balanced against prior beliefs, and when this balance is tipped in the favor of prior beliefs, hallucinations can occur. We show that in-context hallucinations arise when (simulated) subjects cannot use sensory information to correct prior beliefs about hearing a voice, but beliefs about content (i.e. the sequential order of a sentence) remain accurate. When hallucinating subjects also have inaccurate beliefs about state transitions, out-of-context hallucinations occur; i.e. their hallucinated speech content is disordered. Note that out-of-context hallucinations in this setting does not refer to inference about context, but rather to false perceptual inference that emerges when the confidence in-or precision of-sensory evidence is reduced. Furthermore, subjects with inaccurate beliefs about state transitions but an intact ability to use sensory information do not hallucinate and are reminiscent of prodromal patients. This work demonstrates the different computational mechanisms that may underlie the spectrum of hallucinatory experience-from the healthy population to psychotic states.",

      "abstract": "Background: To interact successfully with their environment, humans need to build a model to make sense of noisy and ambiguous inputs. An inaccurate model, as suggested to be the case for people with psychosis, disturbs optimal action selection. Recent computational models, such as active inference, have emphasized the importance of action selection, treating it as a key part of the inferential process. Based on an active inference framework, we sought to evaluate previous knowledge and belief precision in an action-based task, given that alterations in these parameters have been linked to the development of psychotic symptoms. We further sought to determine whether task performance and modelling parameters would be suitable for classification of patients and controls. Methods: Twenty-three individuals with an at-risk mental state, 26 patients with first-episode psychosis and 31 controls completed a probabilistic task in which action choice (go/no-go) was dissociated from outcome valence (gain or loss). We evaluated group differences in performance and active inference model parameters and performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses to assess group classification. Results: We found reduced overall performance in patients with psychosis. Active inference modelling revealed that patients showed increased forgetting, reduced confidence in policy selection and less optimal general choice behaviour, with poorer action–state associations. Importantly, ROC analysis showed fair-to-good classification performance for all groups, when combining modelling parameters and performance measures. Limitations: The sample size is moderate. Conclusion: Active inference modelling of this task provides further explanation for dysfunctional mechanisms underlying decision-making in psychosis and may be relevant for future research on the development of biomarkers for early identification of psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Recent theoretical work in developmental psychology suggests that humans are predisposed to align their mental states with those of other individuals. One way this manifests is in <i>cooperative communication</i>; that is, intentional communication aimed at aligning individuals' mental states with respect to events in their shared environment. This idea has received strong empirical support. The purpose of this paper is to extend this account by proposing an integrative model of the biobehavioral dynamics of cooperative communication. Our formulation is based on <i>active inference</i>. Active inference suggests that action-perception cycles operate to minimize uncertainty and optimize an individual's internal model of the world. We propose that humans are characterized by an evolved <i>adaptive prior belief</i> that their mental states are aligned with, or similar to, those of conspecifics (i.e., that 'we are the same sort of creature, inhabiting the same sort of niche'). The use of cooperative communication emerges as the principal means to gather evidence for this belief, allowing for the development of a shared narrative that is used to disambiguate interactants' (hidden and inferred) mental states. Thus, by using cooperative communication, individuals effectively attune to a hermeneutic niche composed, in part, of others' mental states; and, reciprocally, attune the niche to their own ends via epistemic niche construction. This means that niche construction enables features of the niche to encode precise, reliable cues about the <i>deontic</i> or <i>shared value</i> of certain action policies (e.g., the utility of using communicative constructions to disambiguate mental states, given expectations about shared prior beliefs). In turn, the alignment of mental states (prior beliefs) enables the emergence of a novel, contextualizing scale of <i>cultural</i> dynamics that encompasses the actions and mental states of the ensemble of interactants and their shared environment. The dynamics of this contextualizing layer of cultural organization feedback, across scales, to constrain the variability of the prior expectations of the individuals who constitute it. Our theory additionally builds upon the active inference literature by introducing a new set of neurobiologically plausible computational hypotheses for cooperative communication. We conclude with directions for future research.",

      "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) extracts single-particle density projections of individual biomolecules. Although cryo-EM is widely used for 3D reconstruction, due to its single-particle nature it has the potential to provide information about a biomolecule's conformational variability and underlying free-energy landscape. However, treating cryo-EM as a single-molecule technique is challenging because of the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in individual particles. In this work, we propose the cryo-BIFE method (cryo-EM Bayesian Inference of Free-Energy profiles), which uses a path collective variable to extract free-energy profiles and their uncertainties from cryo-EM images. We test the framework on several synthetic systems where the imaging parameters and conditions were controlled. We found that for realistic cryo-EM environments and relevant biomolecular systems, it is possible to recover the underlying free energy, with the pose accuracy and SNR as crucial determinants. We then use the method to study the conformational transitions of a calcium-activated channel with real cryo-EM particles. Interestingly, we recover not only the most probable conformation (used to generate a high-resolution reconstruction of the calcium-bound state) but also a metastable state that corresponds to the calcium-unbound conformation. As expected for turnover transitions within the same sample, the activation barriers are on the order of [Formula: see text]. We expect our tool for extracting free-energy profiles from cryo-EM images to enable more complete characterization of the thermodynamic ensemble of biomolecules.",

Here we specify and simulate a Markov decision process (MDP) model for ant colony foraging. We investigate a well-known paradigm from laboratory ant colony behavioral experiments, the alternating T-maze paradigm, to illustrate the ability of the model to recover basic colony phenomena such as trail formation after food location discovery.

By revisiting a gene network that explains the anterior-posterior patterning of the vertebrate telencephalon, we found that upon increasing the cooperative effect within this network, fixed points gradually evolve, accompanied by the occurrence of two bifurcations. The dynamic behavior of this network is informed by the knowledge obtained from experiments on telencephalic evolution.

The free energy principle dictates that in order to resist a natural tendency towards disorder self-organizing systems must generate models that predict the hidden causes of phenomenal experience. In other words, they must make sense of things. In both an evolutionary and ontogenetic sense, the narrative self develops as a model that makes sense of experience. However, the self-model skews the interpretation of experience towards that which is predictable, or already \"known.\" One may say it causes us to \"take things personally.\" Meaning is felt more acutely when defenses are compromised, when the narrative self is offline. This enables meaning-making that is less egocentrically motivated. Dreams, psychosis, and psychedelic states offer glimpses of how we make sense of things absent a coherent narrative self. This has implications for the way we understand such states, and lays bare the powerful reach of attachment in shaping what we experience as meaningful.",

This implies that decision-making, planning and information-seeking are, in a generic sense, 'wishful'. We take an interdisciplinary perspective on this perplexing aspect of the free-energy principle and unpack the epistemological implications of wishful thinking under the free-energy principle. We use this epistemic framing to discuss the emergence of biases for self-evidencing agents. In particular, we argue that this elucidates an optimism bias as a foundational tenet of self-evidencing. We allude to a historical precursor to some of these themes, interestingly found in Machiavelli's oeuvre, to contextualise the universal optimism of the free-energy principle.",

      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) has been associated with a rich set of symptoms that are said to be uncomfortable, unwilled, and effortful to manage. Furthermore, tics, the canonical characteristic of TS, are multifaceted, and their onset and maintenance is complex. A formal account that integrates these features of TS symptomatology within a plausible theoretical framework is currently absent from the field. In this paper, we assess the explanatory power of hierarchical generative modelling in accounting for TS symptomatology from the perspective of active inference. We propose a fourfold analysis of sensory, motor, and cognitive phenomena associated with TS. In Section 1, we characterise tics as a form of action aimed at sensory attenuation. In Section 2, we introduce the notion of epistemic ticcing and describe such behaviour as the search for evidence that there is an agent (i.e., self) at the heart of the generative hierarchy. In Section 3, we characterise both epistemic (sensation-free) and nonepistemic (sensational) tics as habitual behaviour. Finally, in Section 4, we propose that ticcing behaviour involves an inevitable conflict between distinguishable aspects of selfhood; namely, between the minimal phenomenal sense of self-which is putatively underwritten by interoceptive inference-and the explicit preferences that constitute the individual's conceptual sense of self. In sum, we aim to provide an empirically informed analysis of TS symptomatology under active inference, revealing a continuity between covert and overt features of the condition.",

An elementary structural unit is proposed, in which synaptic connections at mesoscale are arranged in paired patterns with mirror symmetry. Exchanges of synaptic flux in each pattern form coupled spatial eigenmodes, and the line of mirror reflection between the paired patterns operates as a Markov blanket, so that prediction errors in exchanges between the pairs are minimized. The theoretical analysis is then compared to the outcomes from a biological model of neocortical development, in which neuron precursors are selected by apoptosis for cell body and synaptic connections maximizing synchrony and also minimizing axonal length. It is shown that this model results in patterns of connection with the anticipated mirror symmetries, at micro-, meso- and inter-arial scales, among lateral connections, and in cortical depth. This explains the spatial organization and functional significance of neuron response preferences, and is compatible with the structural form of both columnar and noncolumnar cortex. Multi-way interactions of mirrored representations can provide a preliminary anatomically realistic model of cortical information processing.",

Using a generic model of physical interactions, we prove a theorem and several corollaries that severely restrict applicable notions of self-observation, self-representation, and self-control. We show, in particular, that adding observational, representational, or control capabilities to a meta-level component of a system cannot, even in principle, lead to a complete meta-level representation of the system as a whole.

It argues that hunches - often vital in high-stakes situations - should not be described as mere intuitions, but as intricate products of our mind's generative models. These models, shaped by observations of the social world and assimilated and enacted through active inference, seek to reduce surprise and make hunches an indispensable tool for officers, in exactly the same way that hypotheses are indispensable for scientists. However, the predictive validity of hunches is influenced by a range of factors, including experience and bias, thus warranting critical examination of their reliability. This article not only explores the formation of police hunches but also provides practical insights for officers and researchers on how to harness the power of active inference to fully understand policing decisions and subsequently explore new avenues for future research.",

Here, we propose that the central cerebellar function is to estimate how states interact with each other, and to use these estimates to coordinates extra-cerebellar neuronal dynamics underpinning a range of interconnected behaviours. To support this claim, we describe a cerebellar model for state estimation that includes state interactions, and link this model with the neuronal architecture and dynamics observed empirically. This is formalised using the free energy principle, which provides a dual perspective on a system in terms of both the dynamics of its physical-in this case neuronal-states, and the inferential process they entail. As a demonstration of this proposal, we simulate cerebellar-dependent synchronisation of whisking and respiration, which are known to be tightly coupled in rodents, as well as limb and tail coordination during locomotion. In summary, we propose that the ubiquitous involvement of the cerebellum in behaviour arises from its central role in precisely coupling behavioural domains.",

      "abstract": "Active inference (AIF) is a theory of the behavior of information-processing open dynamic systems. It describes them as generative models (GM) generating inferences on the causes of sensory input they receive from their environment. Based on these inferences, GMs generate predictions about sensory input. The discrepancy between a prediction and the actual input results in prediction error. GMs then execute action policies predicted to minimize the prediction error. The free-energy principle provides a rationale for AIF by stipulating that information-processing open systems must constantly minimize their free energy (through suppressing the cumulative prediction error) to avoid decay. The theory of homeostasis and allostasis has a similar logic. Homeostatic set points are expectations of living organisms. Discrepancies between set points and actual states generate stress. For optimal functioning, organisms avoid stress by preserving homeostasis. Theories of AIF and homeostasis have recently converged, with AIF providing a formal account for homeo- and allostasis. In this paper, we present bacterial chemotaxis as molecular AIF, where mutual constraints by extero- and interoception play an essential role in controlling bacterial behavior supporting homeostasis. Extending this insight to the brain, we propose a conceptual model of the brain homeostatic GM, in which we suggest partition of the brain GM into ",

The effects of input delay are often overlooked in active inference (AIF), which may lead to significant deviations in state estimation and increased prediction errors, particularly when the system is subjected to a sudden external stimulus. In this paper, a theoretical framework of delayed feedback active inference (DAIF) is proposed to enhance the applicability of AIF to real systems. The probability model of DAIF is defined by incorporating a control distribution into that of AIF. The free energy of DAIF is defined as the sum of the quadratic state, sense, and control prediction error. A predicted state derived from previous states is defined and introduced as the expectation of the prior distribution of the real-time state. A proportional-integral (PI)-like control based on the predicted state is taken to be the expectation of DAIF preference control, whose gain coefficient is inversely proportional to the measurement accuracy variance. To adaptively compensate for external disturbances, a second-order inverse variance accuracy replaces the fixed sensory accuracy of preference control. The simulation results of the trajectory tracking control of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) show that DAIF performs better than AIF in state estimation and disturbance resistance.",

The model solves spatial alternation tasks through reciprocal interactions between the two layers. Disrupting its communication impairs decision-making, which is consistent with empirical evidence.

      "abstract": "Understanding speech in noisy environments is challenging even for individuals with normal hearing, and it poses a significant challenge for those with hearing impairments or listening difficulties. There are limitations associated with the current methods of evaluating speech comprehension in such environments, especially in individuals with peripheral hearing impairments. According to the predictive coding model, speech comprehension is an active inference process that integrates sensory information through the interaction of bottom-up and top-down processing. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the role of prediction in speech comprehension using an electrophysiological marker of anticipation: stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN).",

High-level cognitive processes can find the best sequence of actions to achieve a goal in uncertain environments, but they are slow and require significant computational demand. In contrast, lower-level processing allows reacting to environmental stimuli rapidly, but with limited capacity to determine optimal actions or to replan when expectations are not met. Through reiteration of the same task, biological organisms find the optimal tradeoff: from action primitives, composite trajectories gradually emerge by creating task-specific neural structures.

This framework holds a multidimensional outlook on psychopathologies focusing on functional domains of behavior and their implementing neural circuits. In parallel, the Predictive Processing (PP) framework stands as a leading theory of human brain function, offering a unified explanation for various types of information processing in the brain. While both frameworks share an interest in studying psychopathologies based on pathophysiology, their integration still needs to be explored. Here, we argued in favor of the explanatory power of PP to be a groundwork for the RDoC matrix in validating its constructs and creating testable hypotheses about mechanistic interactions between molecular biomarkers and clinical traits.

      "abstract": "Mental representations of the environment in infants are sparse and grow richer during their development. Anticipatory eye fixation studies show that infants aged around 7 months start to predict the goal of an observed action, e.g., an object targeted by a reaching hand. Interestingly, goal-predictive gaze shifts occur at an earlier age when the hand subsequently manipulates an object and later when an action is performed by an inanimate actor, e.g., a mechanical claw. We introduce CAPRI2 (Cognitive Action PRediction and Inference in Infants), a computational model that explains this development from a functional, algorithmic perspective. It is based on the theory that infants learn object files and events as they develop a physical reasoning system. In particular, CAPRI2 learns a generative event-predictive model, which it uses to both interpret sensory information and infer goal-directed behavior. When observing object interactions, CAPRI2 (i) interprets the unfolding interactions in terms of event-segmented dynamics, (ii) maximizes the coherence of its event interpretations, updating its internal estimates and (iii) chooses gaze behavior to minimize expected uncertainty. As a result, CAPRI2 mimics the developmental pathway of infants' goal-predictive gaze behavior. Our modeling work suggests that the involved event-predictive representations, longer-term generative model learning, and shorter-term retrospective and active inference principles constitute fundamental building blocks for the effective development of goal-predictive capacities.",

      "abstract": "Although research including biological concepts and variables has gained more prominence in sociology, progress assimilating the organ of experience, the brain, has been theoretically and technically challenging. Formal uptake and assimilation have thus been slow. Within psychology and neuroscience, the traditional brain, which has made brief appearances in sociological research, is a \"bottom-up\" processor in which sensory signals are passed up the neural hierarchy where they are eventually cognitively and emotionally processed, after which actions and responses are generated. In this paper, we introduce the Active Inference Framework (AIF), which casts the brain as a Bayesian \"inference engine\" that tests its \"top-down\" predictive models against \"bottom-up\" sensory error streams in its attempts to resolve uncertainty and make the world more predictable. After assembling and presenting key concepts in the AIF, we describe an integrated neuro-bio-social model that prioritizes the microsociological assertion that the scene of action is the situation, wherein brains enculturate. Through such social dynamics, enculturated brains share models of the world with one another, enabling collective realities that disclose the actions afforded in those times and places. We conclude by discussing this neuro-bio-social model within the context of exemplar sociological research areas, including the sociology of stress and health, the sociology of emotions, and cognitive cultural sociology, all areas where the brain has received some degree of recognition and incorporation. In each case, sociological insights that do not fit naturally with the traditional brain model emerge intuitively from the predictive AIF model, further underscoring the interconnections and interdependencies between these areas, while also providing a foundation for a probabilistic sociology.",

Current research has shown great variability and even failure among human participants in learning to self-regulate target features of brain activity with neurofeedback. A better understanding of cognitive mechanisms, psychological factors and neural substrates underlying self-regulation might help improve neurofeedback's scientific and clinical practices. This article reviews the current understanding of the neural mechanisms of brain self-regulation by drawing on findings from human and animal studies in neurofeedback, brain-computer/machine interfaces and neuroprosthetics. In this article, we look closer at the following topics: cognitive processes and psychophysiological factors affecting self-regulation, theoretical models and neural substrates underlying self-regulation, and finally, we provide an outlook on the outstanding gaps in knowledge and technical challenges.

Here, we fit active inference and reinforcement learning computational models to a novel two-armed bandit reversal learning task capable of capturing engagement behaviour in rats. The model revealed that after receiving psilocybin, rats achieve more rewards through increased task engagement, mediated by modification of forgetting rates and reduced loss aversion.

      "abstract": "Active inference describes (Bayes-optimal) behaviour as being motivated by the minimisation of surprise of one's sensory observations, through the optimisation of a generative model (of the hidden causes of one's sensory data) in the brain. One of active inference's key appeals is its conceptualisation of precision as biasing neuronal communication and, thus, inference within generative models. The importance of precision in perceptual inference is evident-many studies have demonstrated the importance of ensuring precision estimates are correct for normal (healthy) sensation and perception. Here, we highlight the many roles precision plays in action, i.e., the key processes that rely on adequate estimates of precision, from decision making and action planning to the initiation and control of muscle movement itself. Thereby, we focus on the recent development of hierarchical, \"mixed\" models-generative models spanning multiple levels of discrete and continuous inference. These kinds of models open up new perspectives on the unified description of hierarchical computation, and its implementation, in action. Here, we highlight how these models reflect the many roles of precision in action-from planning to execution-and the associated pathologies if precision estimation goes wrong. We also discuss the potential biological implementation of the associated message passing, focusing on the role of neuromodulatory systems in mediating different kinds of precision.",

Brains grow continuously, such that their patterns of connections develop through activity-dependent specification, with the continuing ontogenesis of individual experience. The theory of active inference proposes that the developmental organization of sentient systems reflects general processes of informatic self-evidencing, through the minimization of free energy. We interpret this theory to imply that the mind may be described in information terms that are not dependent on a specific physical substrate. At a certain level of complexity, self-evidencing of living (self-organizing) information systems becomes hierarchical and reentrant, such that effective consciousness emerges as the consequence of a good regulator. We propose that these principles imply that an adequate reconstruction of the computational dynamics of an individual human brain/mind is possible with sufficient neuromorphic computational emulation.",

It is also challenging, suggesting important questions about scope and dangers while casting further doubt (as if any was needed) on old assumptions about a firm mind/body divide.

AIF and PP posit that the mind constructs a model of the environment which guides behavior by continually generating and integrating predictions and sensory input. The proposed model of the translation agent consists of three processing strata: a sensorimotor layer, a cognitive layer, and a phenomenal layer. Each layer consists of a network of states and transitions that interact on different time scales. Following the AIF framework, states are conditioned on observations which may originate from the environment and/or the embedded processing layer, while transitions between states are conditioned on actions that implement plans to optimize goal-oriented behavior. The AIF agent aims at simulating the variation in translational behavior under various conditions and to facilitate investigating the underlying mental mechanisms. It provides a novel framework for generating and testing new hypotheses of the translating mind.",

But our worlds now include increasing numbers of powerful and (apparently) disembodied generative artificial intelligence (AI). In what follows we ask how best to understand these new (somewhat 'alien', because of their disembodied nature) resources and how to incorporate them in our educational practices. We focus on methodologies that encourage exploration and embodied interactions with 'prepared' material environments, such as the carefully organized settings of Montessori education. Using the active inference framework, we approach our questions by thinking about human learning as epistemic foraging and prediction error minimization. We end by arguing that generative AI should figure naturally as new elements in prepared learning environments by facilitating sequences of precise prediction error enabling trajectories of self-correction. In these ways, we anticipate new synergies between (apparently) di",

      "abstract": "Understandings of how visual hallucinations appear have been highly influenced by generative approaches, in particular Friston's Active Inference conceptualization. Their core proposition is that these phenomena occur when hallucinatory expectations outweigh actual sensory data. This imbalance occurs as the brain seeks to minimize informational free energy, a measure of the distance between predicted and actual sensory data in a stationary open system. We review this approach in the light of old and new information on the role of environmental factors in episodic hallucinations. In particular, we highlight the possible relationship of specific visual triggers to the onset and offset of some episodes. We use an analogy from phase transitions in physics to explore factors which might account for intermittent shifts between veridical and hallucinatory vision. In these triggered forms of hallucinations, we suggest that there is a transient disturbance in the normal one-to-one correspondence between a real object and the counterpart perception such that this correspondence becomes between the real object and a hallucination. Generative models propose that a lack of information transfer from the environment to the brain is one of the key features of hallucinations. In contrast, we submit that specific information transfer is required at onset and offset in these cases. We propose that this transient one-to-one correspondence between environment and hallucination is mediated more by aberrant discriminative than by generative inference. Discriminative inference can be conceptualized as a process for maximizing shared information between the environment and perception within a self-organizing nonstationary system. We suggest that generative inference plays the greater role in established hallucinations and in the persistence of individual hallucinatory episodes. We further explore whether thermodynamic free energy may be an additional factor in why hallucinations are temporary. Future empirical research could productively concentrate on three areas. Firstly, subjective perceptual changes and parallel variations in brain function during specific transitions between veridical and hallucinatory vision to inform models of how episodes occur. Secondly, systematic investigation of the links between environment and hallucination episodes to probe the role of information transfer in triggering transitions between veridical and hallucinatory vision. Finally, changes in hallucinatory episodes over time to elucidate the role of learning on phenomenology. These empirical data will allow the potential roles of different forms of inference in the stages of hallucinatory episodes to be elucidated.",

      "abstract": "Lowering radiation dose per view and utilizing sparse views per scan are two common CT scan modes, albeit often leading to distorted images characterized by noise and streak artifacts. Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) strives to evaluate perceptual quality in alignment with what radiologists perceive, which plays an important role in advancing low-dose CT reconstruction techniques. An intriguing direction involves developing BIQA methods that mimic the operational characteristic of the human visual system (HVS). The internal generative mechanism (IGM) theory reveals that the HVS actively deduces primary content to enhance comprehension. In this study, we introduce an innovative BIQA metric that emulates the active inference process of IGM. Initially, an active inference module, implemented as a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), is constructed to anticipate the primary content. Then, the dissimilarity map is derived by assessing the interrelation between the distorted image and its primary content. Subsequently, the distorted image and dissimilarity map are combined into a multi-channel image, which is inputted into a transformer-based image quality evaluator. By leveraging the DDPM-derived primary content, our approach achieves competitive performance on a low-dose CT dataset.",

      "abstract": "Flow has been described as a state of optimal performance, experienced universally across a broad range of domains: from art to athletics, gaming to writing. However, its phenomenal characteristics can, at first glance, be puzzling. Firstly, individuals in flow supposedly report a loss of self-awareness, even though they perform in a manner which seems to evince their agency and skill. Secondly, flow states are felt to be effortless, despite the prerequisite complexity of the tasks that engender them. In this paper, we unpick these features of flow, as well as others, through the active inference framework, which posits that action and perception are forms of active Bayesian inference directed at sustained self-organisation; i.e., the minimisation of variational free energy. We propose that the phenomenology of flow is rooted in the deployment of high precision weight over (i) the expected sensory consequences of action and (ii) beliefs about how action will sequentially unfold. This computational mechanism thus draws the embodied cognitive system to minimise the ensuing (i.e., expected) free energy through the exploitation of the pragmatic affordances at hand. Furthermore, given the challenging dynamics the flow-inducing situation presents, attention must be wholly focussed on the unfolding task whilst counterfactual planning is restricted, leading to the attested loss of the sense of self-as-object. This involves the inhibition of both the sense of self as a temporally extended object and higher-order, meta-cognitive forms of self-conceptualisation. Nevertheless, we stress that self-awareness is not entirely lost in flow. Rather, it is pre-reflective and bodily. Our approach to bodily-action-centred phenomenology can be applied to similar facets of seemingly agentive experience beyond canonical flow states, providing insights into the mechanisms of so-called selfless experiences, embodied expertise and wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "New insights into intractable industrial challenges can be revealed by framing them in terms of natural science. One intractable industrial challenge is that creative production can be much more financially expensive and time consuming than standardized production. Creative products include a wide range of goods that have one or more original characteristics. The scaling up of creative production is hindered by high financial production costs and long production durations. In this paper, creative production is framed in terms of interactions between entropy and complexity during progressions from emergent pragmatics to action semantics. An analysis of interactions between entropy and complexity is provided that relates established practice in creative production to organizational survival in changing environments. The analysis in this paper is related to assembly theory, which is a recent theoretical development in natural science that addresses how open-ended generation of complex physical objects can emerge from selection in biology. Parallels between assembly practice in industrial production and assembly theory in natural science are explained through constructs that are common to both, such as assembly index. Overall, analyses reported in the paper reveal that interactions between entropy and complexity underlie intractable challenges in creative production, from the production of individual products to the survival of companies.",

Traditions, norms, laws, and customs foster shared predictions and expectations among individuals, thereby reducing uncertainty in social environments. On the other hand, arts and media expose us to simulated experiences that explore alternative social realities, allowing the predictive machinery of the brain to hone its skills through exposure to a wider array of potentially relevant social circumstances and scenarios. We first review key principles of predictive coding and active inference, and then explore the rationale of cultural traditions and artistic culture in this perspective.

      "abstract": "Understanding adaptive human driving behavior, in particular how drivers manage uncertainty, is of key importance for developing simulated human driver models that can be used in the evaluation and development of autonomous vehicles. However, existing traffic psychology models of adaptive driving behavior either lack computational rigor or only address specific scenarios and/or behavioral phenomena. While models developed in the fields of machine learning and robotics can effectively learn adaptive driving behavior from data, due to their black box nature, they offer little or no explanation of the mechanisms underlying the adaptive behavior. Thus, generalizable, interpretable, computational models of adaptive human driving behavior are still rare. This paper proposes such a model based on active inference, a behavioral modeling framework originating in computational neuroscience. The model offers a principled solution to how humans trade progress against caution through policy selection based on the single mandate to minimize expected free energy. This casts goal-seeking and information-seeking (uncertainty-resolving) behavior under a single objective function, allowing the model to seamlessly resolve uncertainty as a means to obtain its goals. We apply the model in two apparently disparate driving scenarios that require managing uncertainty, (1) driving past an occluding object and (2) visual time-sharing between driving and a secondary task, and show how human-like adaptive driving behavior emerges from the single principle of expected free energy minimization.",

Specifically, we propose that the alignment or 'coherence' between affective arousal (e.g. how excited we 'feel') and autonomic arousal (e.g. heart rate or pupil dilation) may be key for maintaining up-to-date uncertainty representations in dynamic environments. Drawing on recent advances in interoceptive and affective inference, we also propose that arousal coherence reflects interoceptive integration, facilitates adaptive belief updating, and impacts our capacity to adapt to changes in uncertainty, with downstream consequences to well-being. We also highlight the role of meta-awareness of arousal, a third level of inference, which may permit conscious awareness, learning about, and intentional regulation of lower-order sources of arousal. Practices emphasizing meta-awareness of arousal (like meditation) may therefore elicit some of their known benefits via improved arousal coherence. We suggest that arousal coherence is also likely to be associated with markers of adaptive functioning (like emotional awareness and self-regulatory capacities) and discuss mind-body practices that may increase coherence.",

While concerns around social media have become mainstream, little is known about the specific cognitive mechanisms underlying the correlations seen in these studies or why we find it so hard to stop engaging with these platforms when things obviously begin to deteriorate for us. New advances in computational neuroscience, however, are now poised to shed light on this matter. In this paper, we approach the phenomenon of social media addiction through the lens of the active inference framework. According to this framework, predictive agents like us use a 'generative model' of the world to predict our own incoming sense data and act to minimize any discrepancy between the prediction and incoming signal (prediction error). In order to live well and be able to act effectively to minimize prediction error, it is vital that agents like us have a generative model, which not only accurately reflects the regularities of our complex environment but is also flexible and dynamic and able to stay accurate in volatile and turbulent circumstances. In this paper, we propose that some social media platforms are a spectacularly effective way of warping an agent's generative model and of arresting the model's ability to flexibly track and adapt to changes in the environment. We go on to investigate cases of digital tech, which do not have these adverse effects and suggest-based on the active inference framework-some ways to understand why some forms of digital technology pose these risks, while others do not.",

      "abstract": "Usually, positive neurological symptoms are considered as the consequence of a mere, afinalistic and abnormal increase in function of specific brain areas. However, according to the Theory of Active Inference, which argues that action and perception constitute a loop that updates expectations according to a Bayesian model, the brain is rather an explorer that formulates hypotheses and tests them to assess the correspondence between internal models and reality. Moreover, the cerebral cortex is characterised by a continuous \"conflict\" between different brain areas, which constantly attempt to expand in order to acquire more of the limited available computational resources, by means of their dopamine-induced neuroplasticity. Thus, it has recently been suggested that dreams, during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), protect visual brain areas (deprived of their stimuli during rest) from being conquered by other normally stimulated ones. It is therefore conceivable that positive symptoms also have a functional importance for the brain. We evaluate supporting literature data of a 'defensive' role of positive symptoms and the relevance of dopamine-induced neuroplasticity in the context of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Furthermore, the possible functional significance of idiopathic REMS-related behavioural disorder as well as phantom limb syndrome is examined. We suggest that positive neurological symptoms are not merely a passive expression of a damage, but active efforts, related to dopamine-induced plasticity, to maintain a correct relationship between the external world and its brain representation, thus preventing healthy cortical areas from ousting injured ones.",

Creativity emerges from various degrees of interplay between predictive brains and changing environments: ones that repeatedly move the goalposts for our own error-minimizing machinery. By (co)constructing these challenging worlds, we effectively alter and expand the space within which our own prediction engines operate, and that function as 'exploration bubbles' that enable information seeking, uncertainty minimizing minds to penetrate deeper and deeper into artistic, scientific and engineering space.

      "abstract": "This paper concerns the distributed intelligence or federated inference that emerges under belief-sharing among agents who share a common world-and world model. Imagine, for example, several animals keeping a lookout for predators. Their collective surveillance rests upon being able to communicate their beliefs-about what they see-among themselves. But, how is this possible? Here, we show how all the necessary components arise from minimising free energy. We use numerical studies to simulate the generation, acquisition and emergence of language in synthetic agents. Specifically, we consider inference, learning and selection as minimising the variational free energy of posterior (i.e., Bayesian) beliefs about the states, parameters and structure of generative models, respectively. The common theme-that attends these optimisation processes-is the selection of actions that minimise expected free energy, leading to active inference, learning and model selection (a.k.a., structure learning). We first illustrate the role of communication in resolving uncertainty about the latent states of a partially observed world, on which agents have complementary perspectives. We then consider the acquisition of the requisite language-entailed by a likelihood mapping from an agent's beliefs to their overt expression (e.g., speech)-showing that language can be transmitted across generations by active learning. Finally, we show that language is an emergent property of free energy minimisation, when agents operate within the same econiche. We conclude with a discussion of various perspectives on these phenomena; ranging from cultural niche construction, through federated learning, to the emergence of complexity in ensembles of self-organising systems.",

      "abstract": "Bistable perception follows from observing a static, ambiguous, (visual) stimulus with two possible interpretations. Here, we present an active (Bayesian) inference account of bistable perception and posit that perceptual transitions between different interpretations (i.e. inferences) of the same stimulus ensue from specific eye movements that shift the focus to a different visual feature. Formally, these inferences are a consequence of precision control that determines how confident beliefs are and change the frequency with which one can perceive-and alternate between-two distinct percepts. We hypothesized that there are multiple, but distinct, ways in which precision modulation can interact to give rise to a similar frequency of bistable perception. We validated this using numerical simulations of the Necker cube paradigm and demonstrate the multiple routes that underwrite the frequency of perceptual alternation. Our results provide an (enactive) computational account of the intricate precision balance underwriting bistable perception. Importantly, these precision parameters can be considered the computational homologs of particular neurotransmitters-i.e. acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine-that have been previously implicated in controlling bistable perception, providing a computational link between the neurochemistry and perception.",

      "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP) offers a variational calculus-based description for how biological agents persevere through interactions with their environment. Active inference (AI) is a corollary of the FEP, which states that biological agents act to fulfill prior beliefs about preferred future observations (target priors). Purposeful behavior then results from variational free energy minimization with respect to a generative model of the environment with included target priors. However, manual derivations for free energy minimizing algorithms on custom dynamic models can become tedious and error-prone. While probabilistic programming (PP) techniques enable automatic derivation of inference algorithms on free-form models, full automation of AI requires specialized tools for inference on dynamic models, together with the description of an experimental protocol that governs the interaction between the agent and its simulated environment. The contributions of the present paper are two-fold. Firstly, we illustrate how AI can be automated with the use of ForneyLab, a recent PP toolbox that specializes in variational inference on flexibly definable dynamic models. More specifically, we describe AI agents in a dynamic environment as probabilistic state space models (SSM) and perform inference for perception and control in these agents by message passing on a factor graph representation of the SSM. Secondly, we propose a formal experimental protocol for simulated AI. We exemplify how this protocol leads to goal-directed behavior for flexibly definable AI agents in two classical RL examples, namely the Bayesian thermostat and the mountain car parking problems.",

It has been shown in the present paper that the modified Saha equation deduced from the minimum Gibbs or Helmholtz free-energy principle is incorrect. The minimum Gibbs or Helmholtz free-energy principle, which is valid for a single-temperature system as a substitute of the maximum entropy principle in an isolated system, cannot be extended to the two-temperature plasma. A more rigorous thermodynamic derivation of the Saha equation modified to a two-temperature plasma system is presented based on the basic thermodynamic principle that the entropy of an isolated system will assume its maximum at the equilibrium state. It is pointed out that one has to pay close attention to the chemical potential expressions for the case of the two-temperature plasma, since any negligence may cause mistakes in the derivation of the two-temperature Saha equation.",

      "abstract": "PRX-3140 is a partial agonist to the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 (5-HT4) and a ligand for the sigma-1 (S1R) and sigma-2 (S2R) receptors. Although few publications have inferred S1R agonists/antagonists modulate blood glucose, Di et.al (2017) reported S1R deficiency in knockout mice impacted regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, with a dexamethasone-induced reduction in level of corticosterone markedly attenuated in S1R -/- knockout mice, implicating S1R in feedback response to the HPA axis. The hypothesis that S1R deficiency causes down-regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and attenuates GR-mediated feedback inhibition of HPA axis, as well as stress response of HPA axis, suggest that the inverse, the activation of S1R under normal conditions, may modulate glucocorticoid insulin suppression (as a direct S1R-GR effect) as well as cortisol levels (producing HPA axis feedback inhibition). In the present study, coadministration of 10 {micro}M PRX-3140 with 100 nM cortisol significantly increased insulin release (to 74.8 ng/ml, P-value <0.0001). Similar effects were observed when cells were exposed to dexamethasone (Dex), with 10 {micro}M PRX-3140 and 10 nM Dex producing 1.87-fold significantly more insulin than 10 nM Dex alone. Daily glucose concentrations in the 14-day clinical study (NCT00384423) of PRX-3140 demonstrate a reduction for 10 mg once-daily at days 1, 7, 10, and 15. Urine free cortisol levels at 10, 30, 100 and 200 mg dose levels of PRX-3140 demonstrated a larger reduction at 7 and 14 days compared to placebo. As an agonist of S1R that acts as a chaperone of GR, PRX-3140 has demonstrated GR modulating effects in INS-1 cells and in 14-day clinical studies in healthy adults with low incidence of side effects. The results of the present study suggest that S1R activation, with PRX-3140 and NP-18-2 S1R agonists, modulates glucocorticoid insulin suppression and cortisol levels.",

Although lifesaving, the degree and durability of weight recovery with RUSF is unpredictable. We examined whether environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) and gut microbiota perturbations are risk factors for RUSF failure in a birth cohort of 416 rural Pakistani children followed for growth, common childhood illnesses, and biomarkers from blood, urine, and stool. Infants who developed wasting (weight-for-length Z score <-2, n=187, 45%) during surveillance received Acha Mum (a chickpea-based RUSF) daily for eight weeks. Machine learning identified seven biomarkers that predicted RUSF response (n=75) vs. non-response (n=112) with 73% accuracy. Remarkably, gut microbiome composition predicted RUSF response with 93% (pre-supplementation) and 98% (post-supplementation) accuracy. Seven outliers whose microbiome falsely predicted positive response experienced extraordinary burdens of inflammation and illness during supplementation. These findings identify gut microbial signatures and biomarkers of gut and systemic inflammation as robust predictors of RUSF response in infants free from intercurrent illness during recovery, setting the stage for predictive models to guide precision use of RUSF and adjunct therapies in undernourished children.",

In these cases, the robot first needs to actively query multiple observations and accumulate information before it can complete a task. In this paper, we cast this problem of active vision as active inference, which states that an intelligent agent maintains a generative model of its environment and acts in order to minimize its surprise, or expected free energy according to this model. We apply this to an object-reaching task for a 7-DOF robotic manipulator with an in-hand camera to scan the workspace. A novel generative model using deep neural networks is proposed that is able to fuse multiple views into an abstract representation and is trained from data by minimizing variational free energy. We validate our approach experimentally for a reaching task in simulation in which a robotic agent starts without any knowledge about its workspace. Each step, the next view pose is chosen by evaluating the expected free energy. We find that by minimizing the expected free energy, exploratory behavior emerges when the target object to reach is not in view, and the end effector is moved to the correct reach position once the target is located. Similar to an owl scavenging for prey, the robot naturally prefers higher ground for exploring, approaching its target once located.",

The computational model is grounded within the formal framework of Active Inference, which considers top-down prediction and attention dynamics as key to perceptual inference and action selection. In a series of simulations, we use the computational model to reproduce key facets of adaptive and maladaptive symptom perception: the ways we infer our bodily state by integrating prior information and somatic afferents; the ways we decide whether or not to attend to somatic channels; the ways we use the symptom inference to make decisions about taking or not taking a medicine; and the ways all the above processes can go awry, determining symptom misperception and ensuing maladaptive behaviors, such as hypervigilance or excessive medicine use. While recent existing theoretical treatments of psychopathological conditions focus on prediction-based perception (predictive coding), our computational model goes beyond them, in at least two ways. First, it includes action and attention selection dynamics that are disregarded in previous conceptualizations but are crucial to fully understand the phenomenology of bodily symptom perception and misperception. Second, it is a fully implemented model that generates specific (and personalized) quantitative predictions, thus going beyond previous qualitative frameworks.

We intend this as a first step toward a computational model of resilient systems. We begin by offering a conceptual analysis of resilience, to clarify its meaning, as established in the literature. We examine an orthogonal, threefold distinction between meanings of the word “resilience”: (i) inertia, or the ability to resist change (ii) elasticity, or the ability to bounce back from a perturbation, and (iii) plasticity, or the ability to flexibly expand the repertoire of adaptive states. We then situate all three senses of resilience within active inference. We map resilience as inertia onto high precision beliefs, resilience as elasticity onto relaxation back to characteristic (i.e., attracting) states, and resilience as plasticity onto functional redundancy and structural degeneracy.",

      "abstract": "Classical imitation learning methods suffer substantially from the learning hierarchical policies when the imitative agent faces an unobserved state by the expert agent. To address these drawbacks, we propose an online active learning through active inference approach that encodes the expert’s demonstrations based on observation-action to improve the learner’s future motion prediction. For this purpose, we provide a switching Dynamic Bayesian Network based on the dynamic interaction between the expert agent and another object in its surrounding as a reference model, which we exploit to initialize an incremental probabilistic learning model. This learning model grows and matures based on the free-energy formulation and message passing of active inference dynamically at discrete and continuous levels in an online active learning phase. In this scheme, generalized states of the learning world are represented as distance-vector, where it is the learner’s observation concerning its interaction with a moving object. Considering the distance vector entail intentions, it enables action prediction evaluation in a prospective sense. We illustrate these points using simulations of driving intelligent agents. The learning agent is trained by using long-term predictions from the generative learning model to reproduce the expert’s motion while learning how to select a suitable action through new experiences. Our results affirm that a Dynamic Bayesian optimal approach provides a principled framework and outperforms conventional reinforcement learning methods. Furthermore, it endorses the general formulation of action prediction as active inference.",

      "abstract": "Visual saliency can be thought of as the product of human brain activity. Most existing models were built upon local features or global features or both. Lately, a so-called free energy principle unifies several brain theories within one framework, and tells where easily surprise human viewers in a visual stimulus through a psychological measure. We believe that this \"surprise\" should be highly related to visual saliency, and thereby introduce a novel computational Free Energy inspired Saliency detection technique (FES). Our method computes the local entropy of the gap between an input image signal and its predicted counterpart that is reconstructed from the input one with a semi-parametric model. Experimental results prove that our algorithm predicts human fixation points accurately and is superior to classical/state-of-the-art competitors.",

      "abstract": "The 4Rs of sports nutrition were proposed in recent years as an evidence-based framework to optimize post-exercise recovery within the context of allostasis. Under this paradigm, it is important to consider that each R represents a factor with a tremendous influence on the allostatic response and improves individual components of the allostatic load (AL), which will positively impact the exercise-induced adaptations and the athlete's recovery. The 4Rs correspond to the following. (i) Rehydration-This is necessary to guarantee the post-exercise consumption of at least 150% of the body mass lost during the exercise accompanied by sodium (if faster replacement is required). (ii) Refuel-Carbohydrate intake (~1.2 g/kg body mass per hour for up to 4 h post-exercise) is essential not only in restoring glycogen reserves but also in supporting the energy needs of the immune system and facilitating tissue repair. Despite changes in substrate utilization, a ketogenic diet generally has neutral or negative effects on athletic performance compared to carbohydrate-rich diets. (iii) Repair-The ingestion of high-quality protein stimulates post-exercise net muscle protein anabolism and might contribute to faster tissue growth and repair. The use of certain supplements, such as creatine monohydrate, might help to enhance recovery, while tart cherry, omega-3 fatty acids, and dietary nitrate (e.g., <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, <i>Amaranthus</i> L.), as well as other herbal extracts containing flavonoid-rich polyphenols, deserve further clinical research. (iv) Recuperate-Pre-sleep nutrition (casein- or protein-rich meal with slow digestion rate) has a restorative effect, facilitating the recovery of the musculoskeletal, endocrine, immune, and nervous systems. In this article, we update the 4Rs framework, delve deeper into the allostasis paradigm, and offer theoretical foundations and practical recommendations (the 4Rs app) for the assessment of AL in athletes. We cautiously propose an AL index (AL<sub>index</sub>) for physique competitors and elite athletes to evaluate the cumulative physiological stress induced by exercise and, thereby, to adjust exercise and nutrition interventions.",

      "abstract": "Acupuncture is a medical tool in which a sterile needle is used to penetrate and stimulate a certain body area (<i>acupoint</i>), inducing a series of sensations such as numbness, dullness, or aching, often referred to as <i>de-qi</i>. But is that all? In this article, we adopt a Bayesian perspective to explore the cognitive and affective aspects of acupuncture beyond needling, specifically, how the body integrates bottom-up sensory signals with top-down predictions of acupuncture perception. We propose that the way in which we discern acupuncture treatment is the result of predictive coding, a probabilistic, inferential process of our brain. Active inference from both prior experience and expectations of acupuncture, when integrated with incoming sensory signals, creates a unique, individual internal generative model of our perception of acupuncture. A Bayesian framework and predictive coding may, therefore, aid in elucidating and quantifying the cognitive components of acupuncture and facilitate understanding of their differential interactions in determining individual expectations of treatment. Thus, a perception-based Bayesian model of acupuncture presented in this article may expand on how we perceive acupuncture treatment, from simply inserting needles into our body to one that encompasses a complex healing process supported by belief and hope of regaining health. By exploring how cognitive factors influence individual responsiveness to acupuncture treatment, this review sheds light on why acupuncture treatment is more effective in some individuals than in others.",

      "abstract": "Anxious emotional states disrupt decision-making and control of dexterous motor actions. Computational work has shown that anxiety-induced uncertainty alters the rate at which we learn about the environment, but the subsequent impact on the predictive beliefs that drive action control remains to be understood. In the present work we tested whether anxiety alters predictive (oculo)motor control mechanisms. Thirty participants completed an experimental task that consisted of manual interception of a projectile performed in virtual reality. Participants were subjected to conditions designed to induce states of high or low anxiety using performance incentives and social-evaluative pressure. We measured subsequent effects on physiological arousal, self-reported state anxiety, and eye movements. Under high pressure conditions we observed visual sampling of the task environment characterised by higher variability and entropy of position prior to release of the projectile, consistent with an active attempt to reduce uncertainty. Computational modelling of predictive beliefs, using gaze data as inputs to a partially observable Markov decision process model, indicated that trial-to-trial updating of predictive beliefs was reduced during anxiety, suggesting that updates to priors were constrained. Additionally, state anxiety was related to a less deterministic mapping of beliefs to actions. These results support the idea that organisms may attempt to counter anxiety-related uncertainty by moving towards more familiar and certain sensorimotor patterns.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Chronic low back pain (CLBP) and depressive symptoms (DS) are highly prevalent, burdensome, costly and comorbid health conditions. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) was shown to improve pain and disability in patients with CLBP; however, the effect on comorbid DS remains less certain. Interestingly, CLBP and DS seem to be associated with changes in interoception, which may be reversed by OMT.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>The study protocol proposes a single-blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial to investigate the effect of OMT on clinical symptoms (depression, pain and disability) and interoceptive functions (interoceptive accuracy, sensibility and awareness) in patients with CLBP and comorbid DS. A sample of 60 adult subjects with CLBP and comorbid DS shall be recruited from osteopathic, orthopaedic and physiotherapeutic practices and educational institutes for osteopathy, sports science, psychology and medicine in Hamburg, Germany. Participants will be randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive six 45 min treatment sessions of either OMT (standard-OMT group) or sham treatment imitating OMT (sham-OMT group). Primarily, symptoms of depression, pain and disability will be assessed with the Beck's Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Secondarily, interoceptive accuracy, sensibility and awareness will be evaluated using the Heartbeat Tracking Task (HTT), Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA-2) and confidence-accuracy correspondence (CAC). Ancillary, the therapeutic alliance will be investigated with the Helping Alliance Questionnaire. Data will be collected at baseline (t<sub>0</sub>), the first, third and sixth treatment sessions (t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>3</sub>, t<sub>6</sub>) and at 3 months follow-up (t<sub>7</sub>). The findings will be analysed for between-group differences using descriptive (mean and SD) and inductive statistics (mixed analysis of variance). It is hypothesised that standard-OMT, compared with sham-OMT, will reduce depression, pain and disability (BDI-II, NRS, ODI) and increase interoceptive accuracy, sensibility and awareness (HTT, MAIA-2, CAC) in patients with CLBP and comorbid DS.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical School Hamburg (MSH-2023/288). The anonymised dataset will be published in an online repository, and the results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.<h4>Trial registration number</h4>DRKS00031694.",

      "abstract": "Understanding competitive inhibition at the molecular level is essential for unraveling the dynamics of enzyme-inhibitor interactions and predicting the evolutionary outcomes of resistance mutations. In this study, we present a framework linking competitive inhibition to alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, focusing on <i>Escherichia coli</i> dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and its inhibition by trimethoprim (TMP). Using thermodynamic cycles, we relate experimentally measured binding constants (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>) to free energy differences associated with wild-type and mutant forms of DHFR with a mean error of 0.9 kcal/mol, providing insight into the molecular underpinnings of TMP resistance. Our findings highlight the importance of local conformational dynamics in competitive inhibition. Mutations in DHFR affect substrate and inhibitor binding affinities differently, influencing the fitness landscape under selective pressure from TMP. Our FEP simulations reveal that resistance mutations stabilize inhibitor-bound or substrate-bound states through specific structural and/or dynamical effects. The interplay of these effects showcases significant molecular-level epistasis in certain cases. The ability to separately assess substrate and inhibitor binding provides valuable insights, allowing for a more precise interpretation of mutation effects and epistatic interactions. Furthermore, we identify key challenges in FEP simulations, including convergence issues arising from charge-changing mutations and long-range allosteric effects. By integrating computational and experimental data, we provide an effective approach for predicting the functional impact of resistance mutations and their contributions to evolutionary fitness landscapes. These insights pave the way for constructing robust mutational scanning protocols and designing more effective therapeutic strategies against resistant bacterial strains.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Decision-making under approach-avoidance conflict (AAC; e.g., sacrificing quality of life to avoid feared outcomes) may be affected in multiple psychiatric disorders. Recently, we used a computational (active inference) model to characterize information processing differences during AAC in individuals with depression, anxiety and/or substance use disorders. Individuals with psychiatric disorders exhibited increased decision uncertainty (DU) and reduced sensitivity to unpleasant stimuli. This preregistered study aimed to determine the replicability of this processing dysfunction.<h4>Methods</h4>A new sample of participants completed the AAC task. Individual-level computational parameter estimates, reflecting decision uncertainty and sensitivity to unpleasant stimuli (\"emotion conflict\"; EC), were obtained and compared between groups. Subsequent analyses combining the prior and current samples allowed assessment of narrower disorder categories.<h4>Results</h4>The sample in the present study included 480 participants: 97 healthy controls, 175 individuals with substance use disorders and 208 individuals with depression and/or anxiety disorders. Individuals with substance use disorders showed higher DU and lower EC values than healthy controls. The EC values were lower in females, but not males, with depression and/or anxiety disorders than in healthy controls. However, the previously observed difference in DU between participants with depression and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls did not replicate. Analyses of specific disorders in the combined samples indicated that effects were common across different substance use disorders and affective disorders.<h4>Limitations</h4>There were differences, although with small effect size, in age and baseline intellectual functioning between the previous and current sample, which may have affected replication of DU differences in participants with depression and/or anxiety disorders.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The now robust evidence base for these clinical group differences motivates specific questions that should be addressed in future research: can DU and EC become behavioural treatment targets, and can we identify neural substrates of DU and EC that could be used to measure severity of dysfunction or as neuromodulatory treatment targets?",

      "abstract": "In previous papers, we introduced a normative scheme for scene construction and epistemic (visual) searches based upon active inference. This scheme provides a principled account of how people decide where to look, when categorising a visual scene based on its contents. In this paper, we use active inference to explain the visual searches of normal human subjects; enabling us to answer some key questions about visual foraging and salience attribution. First, we asked whether there is any evidence for 'epistemic foraging'; i.e. exploration that resolves uncertainty about a scene. In brief, we used Bayesian model comparison to compare Markov decision process (MDP) models of scan-paths that did-and did not-contain the epistemic, uncertainty-resolving imperatives for action selection. In the course of this model comparison, we discovered that it was necessary to include non-epistemic (heuristic) policies to explain observed behaviour (e.g., a reading-like strategy that involved scanning from left to right). Despite this use of heuristic policies, model comparison showed that there is substantial evidence for epistemic foraging in the visual exploration of even simple scenes. Second, we compared MDP models that did-and did not-allow for changes in prior expectations over successive blocks of the visual search paradigm. We found that implicit prior beliefs about the speed and accuracy of visual searches changed systematically with experience. Finally, we characterised intersubject variability in terms of subject-specific prior beliefs. Specifically, we used canonical correlation analysis to see if there were any mixtures of prior expectations that could predict between-subject differences in performance; thereby establishing a quantitative link between different behavioural phenotypes and Bayesian belief updating. We demonstrated that better scene categorisation performance is consistently associated with lower reliance on heuristics; i.e., a greater use of a generative model of the scene to direct its exploration.",

      "abstract": "In human dynamics, functioning relies on intricate coordination patterns. Networks of synchronized oscillators in various biological and semiotic fields shape these dynamics. We have observed stability, instability, and transitions at multiple levels, indicating that coordination happens on all scales. We have examined coordination models for simplified and complex dynamics. In empirical research, we can frequently observe chimera states as the coexistence of coherence and incoherence, even in homogeneous networks. They are more evident in the heterogenous networks' standard in human dynamics, where oscillators and nodes are mixed as different types. This paper proposes a simplified and overarching model for mixed chimeras. We discuss the information dynamics in these types of networks and their pattern transitions.",

      "abstract": "Prior work has demonstrated that higher surprisal, a measure quantifying the unexpectedness of a trigger exposure, predicts headache onset over 12 to 24 h. However, these analyses relied on retrospective expectations of trigger exposure formed after extended data collection. To operationalize surprisal prospectively, Bayesian methods could update expectations dynamically over time. The objective of this study was to extend the application of surprisal theory for predicting migraine attack risk by developing methods to estimate trigger variable likelihood in real time, under conditions of limited personal observation. In a prospective daily diary study of individuals with migraine (N = 104), data were collected over 28 days, including stress, sleep, and exercise exposures. Bayesian models were applied to estimate daily expectations for each variable under uninformative and empirical priors derived from the sample. Stress was modeled using a hurdle-Gamma distribution, sleep using discrete outcomes from a Normal distribution, and exercise using a Bernoulli distribution. Surprisal was calculated based on the predictive distribution at each time point and compared to static empirical surprisal values obtained after full data collection. Dynamic Bayesian surprisal values systematically differed from retrospective empirical estimates, particularly early in the observation period. Divergence was larger and more variable under uninformative priors but attenuated over time. Empirically informed priors produced more stable, lower-bias surprisal trajectories. Substantial individual variability was observed across exposure types, especially for exercise behavior. Prospective surprisal modeling is feasible but highly sensitive to prior specification, especially in sparse data contexts (e.g., a binary exposure). Incorporating empirical or individually informed priors may improve early model calibration, though individual learning remains essential. These methods offer a foundation for real-time headache forecasting and dynamic modeling of brain-environment interactions.",

      "abstract": "The Thoughtseeds Framework introduces a novel computational approach to modeling thought dynamics in meditative states, conceptualizing thoughtseeds as dynamic attentional agents that integrate information. This hierarchical model, structured as nested Markov blankets, comprises three interconnected levels: (i) knowledge domains as information repositories, (ii) the Thoughtseed Network where thoughtseeds compete, and (iii) meta-cognition regulating awareness. It simulates focused-attention Vipassana meditation via rule-based training informed by empirical neuroscience research on attentional stability and neural dynamics. Four states-breath_control, mind_wandering, meta_awareness, and redirect_breath-emerge organically from thoughtseed interactions, demonstrating self-organizing dynamics. Results indicate that experts sustain control dominance to reinforce focused attention, while novices exhibit frequent, prolonged mind_wandering episodes, reflecting beginner instability. Integrating Global Workspace Theory and the Intrinsic Ignition Framework, the model elucidates how thoughtseeds shape a unitary meditative experience through meta-awareness, balancing epistemic and pragmatic affordances via active inference. Synthesizing computational modeling with phenomenological insights, it provides an embodied perspective on cognitive state emergence and transitions, offering testable predictions about meditation skill development. The framework yields insights into attention regulation, meta-cognitive awareness, and meditation state emergence, establishing a versatile foundation for future research into diverse meditation practices (e.g., Open Monitoring, Non-Dual Awareness), cognitive development across the lifespan, and clinical applications in mindfulness-based interventions for attention disorders, advancing our understanding of the nature of mind and thought.",

      "abstract": "From a neuroscience perspective, artificial neural networks are regarded as abstract models of biological neurons, yet they rely on biologically implausible backpropagation for training. Energy-based models represent a class of brain-inspired learning frameworks that adjust system states by minimizing an energy function. Predictive coding (PC), a theoretical model within energy-based models, constructs its energy function from forward prediction errors, with optimization achieved by minimizing local layered errors. Owing to its local plasticity, PC emerges as the most promising alternative to backpropagation. However, PC face gradient explosion and vanishing challenges in deep networks with multiple layers. Gradient explosion occurs when layer-wise prediction errors are excessively large, while gradient vanishing arises when they are excessively small. To address these challenges, we propose bidirectional energy to stabilize prediction errors and mitigate gradient explosion, while using skip connections to resolve gradient vanishing problems. We also introduce a layer-adaptive learning rate (LALR) to enhance training efficiency. Our model achieves accuracies of 99.22% on MNIST, 93.78% on CIFAR-10, 83.96% on CIFAR-100, and 73.35% on Tiny ImageNet, comparable to the performance of identically structed networks trained with backprop. Finally, we developed a Jax-based framework for efficient training of energy-based models, reducing training time by half compared to PyTorch.",

Global Workspace Theory emphasizes cognitive access, Higher-Order Theories focus on metacognitive representation, Integrated Information Theory centers on intrinsic experience, and Predictive Coding Theory models cognitive processes as probabilistic inference. While each theory provides valuable insights, they often remain in conflict due to differing assumptions about the nature of consciousness. This paper proposes a phenomenologically informed framework that clarifies the explanatory scope of each theory in relation to key features of lived experience. Rather than seeking to reduce consciousness to a single principle, I argue for a pluralistic approach that respects the distinctive contributions of each model. Through comparative analysis guided by phenomenological reflection and supported by recent interdisciplinary proposals, I show how these theories can be seen as addressing complementary dimensions of consciousness. The aim is not to construct a single unified theory, but to demonstrate how integration, grounded in reflective phenomenological analysis, can serve as a starting point toward a more adequate science of consciousness.",

      "abstract": "In this perspective, we introduce the <i>Precision Principle</i> as a unifying theoretical framework to explain self-organization across biological systems. Drawing from neurobiology, systems theory, and computational modeling, we propose that precision, understood as constraint-driven coherence, is the key force shaping the architecture, function, and evolution of nervous systems. We identify three interrelated domains: Structural Precision (efficient, modular wiring), Functional Precision (adaptive, context-sensitive circuit deployment), and Evolutionary Precision (selection-guided architectural refinement). Each domain is grounded in local operations such as spatial and temporal averaging, multiplicative co-activation, and threshold gating, which enable biological systems to achieve robust organization without centralized control. Within this framework, we introduce the <i>Precision Coefficient</i>, Pz=Cz-αRz , which formalizes the balance between network coherence and resource cost and serves as a simple quantitative outline of the principle. Conceptually, this formalism aligns with established learning mechanisms: Hebbian reinforcement provides the local substrate for weight changes, while winner-take-all and k-winners competition selectively eliminates weaker synapses, together increasing Cz and reducing redundancy within Rz . Rather than framing the theory in opposition to existing models, we aim to establish the <i>Precision Principle</i> as an original, integrative lens for understanding how systems sustain efficiency, flexibility, and resilience. We hope the framework inspires new research into neural plasticity, development, and artificial systems, by centering internal coherence, not prediction or control, as the primary driver of self-organizing intelligence.",

      "abstract": "Active inference integrates perception, decision-making, and learning into a united theoretical framework, providing an efficient way to trade off exploration and exploitation by minimizing (expected) free energy. In this study, we asked how the brain represents values and uncertainties (novelty and variability), and resolves these uncertainties under the active inference framework in the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Twenty-five participants performed a contextual two-armed bandit task, with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. By comparing the model evidence for active inference and reinforcement learning models of choice behavior, we show that active inference better explains human decision-making under novelty and variability, which entails exploration or information seeking. The EEG sensor-level results show that the activity in the frontal, central, and parietal regions is associated with novelty, while the activity in the frontal and central brain regions is associated with variability. The EEG source-level results indicate that the expected free energy is encoded in the frontal pole and middle frontal gyrus and uncertainties are encoded in different brain regions but with overlap. Our study dissociates the expected free energy and uncertainties in active inference theory and their neural correlates, speaking to the construct validity of active inference in characterizing cognitive processes of human decisions. It provides behavioral and neural evidence of active inference in decision processes and insights into the neural mechanism of human decisions under uncertainties.",

This article provides a comprehensive and critical review of the various techniques available for UAV swarm trajectory planning, which can be broadly categorised into three main groups: traditional algorithms, biologically inspired metaheuristics, and modern artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods. The study examines cutting-edge research, comparing key aspects of trajectory planning, including computational efficiency, scalability, inter-UAV coordination, energy consumption, and robustness in uncertain environments. The strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms are discussed in detail, particularly in the context of collision avoidance, adaptive decision making, and the balance between centralised and decentralised control. Additionally, the review highlights hybrid frameworks that combine the global optimisation power of bio-inspired algorithms with the real-time adaptability of AI-based approaches, aiming to achieve an effective exploration-exploitation trade-off in multi-agent environments. Lastly, the article addresses the major challenges in UAV swarm trajectory planning, including multidimensional trajectory spaces, nonlinear dynamics, and real-time adaptation. It also identifies promising directions for future research. This study serves as a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and system designers working to develop UAV swarms for real-world, integrated, intelligent, and autonomous missions.",

We introduce hedonic foraging as a mechanism by which hedonic evaluation guides behaviour via iterative reward maximisation. This framework integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference, whereby expected free energy encodes wanting—the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes—while variational free energy corresponds to liking—the hedonic impact of the outcome. Hedonic foraging unifies the mechanisms underlying behaviours ranging from allostasis to art appreciation, casting cognition and motivated behaviour as purposive engagement with the environment and its affordances. <h4>Long abstract</h4> Hedonic evaluation shapes behaviour across organisms. Yet, the mechanisms that transform hedonic values into motivated behaviour remain poorly understood, and key questions remain unanswered. How do habits, wanting, and liking or disliking interact to generate behaviour? Do common principles govern behaviour across species and cognitive systems, from basic survival mechanisms to complex cultural endeavours? We propose a unifying theory of motivated behaviour that integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference—a framework in which perception, action and cognition emerge from the imperative to minimise free energy. We argue that variational free energy provides a natural measure of liking and disliking, while expected free energy encodes wanting—the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes. This synthesis, which we term hedonic foraging , offers a principled explanation for how organisms navigate their environments based on pleasure-driven learning and decision-making. It posits that motivated behaviour emerges from the fundamental pursuit of maximising reward, with hedonic evaluation motivating and monitoring actions through wanting and liking mechanisms. We demonstrate that hedonic foraging captures a wide range of behaviours, from allostatic processes common to all animals to sophisticated human activities such as art appreciation and cultural exploration. Crucially, our integrative perspective fosters mutual enrichment between hedonic evaluation and active inference—two fundamental approaches to behaviour. Ultimately, hedonic foraging reinforces the view that cognition is essentially about purposive engagement in adaptive interactions with the environment and its affordances and offers a unified framework for investigating cognition and behaviour.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Rationale</h4>  Apathy is a common symptom in many neurological and psychiatric conditions, associated with poor prognosis and increased caregiver burden. There are currently no proven treatments, in part due to a lack of mechanistic understanding. We have proposed a novel framework for apathy, based on the failure of active inference due to imprecise priors on the outcome of actions. The loss of precision on action outcomes causes apathy by reducing the expected difference between the state of the world following action versus non-action. Here we test the hypothesis that the loss of prior precision on action outcomes is reversible and mediated neuronally by GABAergic gain on the superficial pyramidal neurons in a prefrontal-motor decision-making hierarchy. We test this in a healthy cohort and people with two syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. <h4>Methods</h4>  Twenty healthy controls, twenty people with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and twenty people with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) took part in a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial using zolpidem, an established GABAA agonist. This study was registered with ISRCTN registry (  ISRCTN10616794 ). We use the ‘Goal Prior Assay’ task and dynamic causal modelling of MEG resting-state data to explore the cognitive and neural concomitants of prior precision, and the effect of GABAergic regulation on both prior precision and superficial pyramidal gain. Apathy was primarily assessed with the Apathy Evaluation Scale (Self and Carer). Principal analyses were conducted using Bayesian statistics, supplemented by classical frequentist tests.  <h4>Results</h4>  Forty-three participants (20 controls and 23 patients) were included in the final analysis. We found strong evidence for a difference in measures of apathy (B>1000, p<0.001) and prior precision (B=20.4, p<0.01) between healthy controls and people with bvFTD and PSP. This difference in prior precision was not found in the drug condition (B=0.86, p=0.11). There was strong evidence of a correlation between apathy and prior precision across groups (B>100, p<0.001). Dynamic causal modelling of MEG resting-state data confirmed reductions in gain on the prefrontal superficial pyramidal neurons in patients. The prefrontal superficial pyramidal gain was partially restored on zolpidem and linked to participants’ prior precision on their action outcomes. <h4>Conclusion</h4>  We confirm that apathy in conditions associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration is underwritten by a reduction in prior precision on action outcomes, mediated by reduced synaptic gain of prefrontal superficial pyramidal neurons. GABAergic regulation using zolpidem partially restores prior precision by acting on this gain and reinstating neuronal message-passing within the prefrontal-motor decision-making hierarchy.",

We propose that MPEs arise when precision weighting shifts predominantly to the lower levels of a hierarchical inferential system, leading to a perceptual state characterized by increased entropy and reduced complexity. Crucially, awareness of this simplified state is main- tained through epistemic depth: The reflexive sharing of the organism’s reality model with itself. Therefore, although the contents of consciousness are exceptionally quiet, a reflexive knowing of the empty field of experience remains. We then propose an in silico simulation to test the relation- ship between precision distribution and entropy, outlining how this model could generate synthetic EEG data to empirically validate the theoretical framework. By advancing our understanding of pure awareness through this computational approach, we provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms underlying various altered states of consciousness, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the full spectrum of conscious experience.</p>",

Starting from the canonical definition of NCCs provided by Crick and Koch (1990) and Chalmers (2000), a series of lemmas and theorems are provided which show how NCCs can be discovered if empirical data about the co-activation of neural states and states of consciousness is available. The result of this analysis is a new method to measure NCCs, which we preliminarily call Co-Activation Analysis (CoAA), that might complement or extend existing methods such as contrastive analysis and decoding. CoAA might be of interest for experiments because it does not require data from near-threshold conditions, is compatible with all major conceptions of states of consciousness (including, e.g., micro-phenomenological notions and global states of consciousness), can be applied to most conceptions of neural or computational states (including, e.g., those provided by Predictive Processing/Active Inference, or those attained in more ecological conditions), and helps alleviate the problem of confounders. Furthermore, we show as a theorem that as far as the logic of measurement is concerned, if applied to data from contrastive analysis studies, CoAA improves upon the result provided by contrastive analysis. The paper is a purely theoretical contribution. It is presented in the hope that the mathematics developed here can support and improve the empirical search for NCCs.</p>",

      "abstract": "We combine theoretical biology and systems neuroscience to relate the mechanisms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) models to biopsychosocial complexity. Moving beyond fear conditioning, extinction and habits formed by associative learning, we consider conserved neuromodulatory mechanisms related to harm expectation, defensive mobilisation, and context (in)sensitivity. Our account of harm-mitigating, neurobehavioural responses furnishes a mechanistic understanding of maladaptive behaviour and impaired belief-updating, which are often underspecified in conceptual analyses. Grounded in neurobiological evidence, we specify PTSD-related impairment in terms of Bayesian belief-updating and establish an adaptive/maladaptive boundary using active inference and simulation studies. The ensuing model plausibly illustrates PTSD pathogenesis, which remains understudied relative to aetiology. We locate pathogenesis in maladaptive precision following traumatic learning, characterised by aberrant Bayesian credit assignment. Future scientific and clinical studies can test the validity of these insights, which could underwrite our understanding of the phenomenology, diagnostics and ultimately treatment intervention in post-traumatic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Muscle vibration alters both perceived limb position and velocity by increasing type Ia afferent firing rates, although these afferents mainly encode velocity. Predictive frameworks of sensori-motor control, such as Active Inference and Optimal Feedback Control, suggest that velocity signals should inform position estimates. Such a function would predict that errors in perceived limb position and velocity should be correlated, but this prediction remains empirically underexplored. We hypothesized that an online evaluation of the integral of sensed velocity influences the perceived arm position during active movements. Using a virtual reality-based reaching task, we investigated how vibration-biased proprioceptive feedback influences voluntary movement control. Our results suggest that muscle vibration biases perceived movement velocity, with downstream effects on perceived limb position and reflexive corrections of movement speed. We found that (i) antagonist vibration during active movement caused participants to both overestimate their movement speed while also slowing down, (ii) movement speed and endpoint errors were correlated, with muscle vibration affecting both, and (iii) adjustments in movement speed to muscle vibration are sufficiently fast to be reflexive. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that proprioceptive velocity signals are integrated to augment inference of position, consistent with predictive frameworks of sensorimotor control. 1 <h4>Key points</h4>  During movement without visual feedback, the central nervous system (CNS) has access to both position- and velocity-based proprioceptive signals, which are used to estimate limb state. Muscle vibration biases the perception of limb position, as seen in the classically observed pattern of biased endpoint errors, through the stimulation of primary (type Ia) muscle spindles, a velocity sensor. We investigated how proprioceptive velocity signals affect position estimation during movement by applying muscle vibration while measuring perceived movement speed, actual movement speed, and endpoint errors in a virtual reality (VR) based reaching task. We show that errors in perceived limb position and velocity are correlated during active movements, consistent with predictive frameworks of sensorimotor control. These findings support the idea that the CNS maintains a self-consistent estimate of limb state across both position and velocity domains.",

PC provides a neuronal scheme (through neurons or neural populations) for implementing Bayesian inference in the brain. PC recovers the hidden state of the world from sensory input (passive inference) and selects actions to reach the goals the agent has (active inference). Since its discovery, PC has been found to be a unifying theory explaining more and more cognitive functions, including perception, attention, and action planning. In this paper, we review and discuss how PC can be used also as a powerful tool to understand working memory (WM), an essential function for executive control. Specifically, we sought answers in the literature to the following questions: 1. How is WM maintained and updated? 2. What is the relationship between attention and WM and how do they interact? 3. Why does WM have limited capacity? and 4. Why is WM hierarchical? Modelling WM in PC frameworks provides alternative explanations to some long-standing questions about WM and may help with resolving the conflicts between WM theories. We expect such alternative explanations can help future researchers, such as in developing computational tools to improve treatments for brain disorders and more robust artificial working memory in artificial intelligence.</p>",

We performed these experiments as part of an adversarial collaboration to test contrasting theories of consciousness; Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Predictive Processing Active Inference (AI), and Predictive Processing Neurorepresentationalism (NREP) accounts. According to the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness, non-activatable retinotopic cortical regions, such as the blind spot region for the ipsilateral eye, create a different cause-effect structure and therefore should contribute differently to the perceived quality of space of activatable retinotopic regions. The two Predictive Processing accounts, in contrast, posit that internal models will accommodate structural deviations around the blindspot based on the available sensory evidence (particulars of this accommodation differ between the two accounts). We present a series of paradigms in which participants evaluate distances and areas that either include the blind spot or not (without stimulating it directly), as well as illusory motion that is either adjacent to the blind spot or not. We model psychometric functions relating perceived and objective space. These models vary in terms of bias and precision according to the experimental conditions (blind spot involved vs. not involved, ipsilateral vs. contralateral eye), making it possible to quantify the potential disruption of subjective spatial extendedness induced by the blind spot. We present simulated results for each experiment corresponding to the predictions of each account, and conclude by discussing challenges and plans for dissemination.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>From the moment we are born, and even before, in the womb, and until our last breath, our bodies move all the time. Adaptive behaviors necessarily depend not only on successful integration of multisensory bodily signals but also on how we move our body in the world. This paper considers the notion of embodied selfhood through the perspective of dynamic and rhythmic coupling between bodily movements and bodily actions. We propose a new theoretical framework suggesting that the dynamic coupling between bodily movements and bodily actions in the world are fundamental in constructing and maintaining a coherent sense of self. To support this idea, we use the Predictive Processing (PP) and Active Inference framework as our background theoretical canvas. Specifically, we will focus on the phenomenon of somatosensory attenuation in relation to dynamic selfhood, and argue that rhythmic bodily signals such as heartbeats, breathing, and walking patterns are predictable and thus, can be smoothly attenuated, i.e. processed in the background. We illustrate this hypothesis by discussing the case of Depersonalisation Disorder as a failure to self-attenuate self-related information processing, leading to feelings of unreality and self loss. Because living systems such as human bodies are finite systems resisting entropy, it is crucial to strike a balance between what sensory information to ignore, and what sensory information to prioritize on the fly. Hence the vital role of the phenomenon of somatosensory attenuation linked to dynamic embodied selfhood, which is designed precisely to deal with this fine balance between attending and dis-attending self- and world-related information in time. When this fragile balance is disrupted, instead of fixing the self alone, or the individual per se, one needs to address the relationship between the individuals’ sense of self, bodily movements and bodily actions in the physical and social world. We conclude with potential implications of our hypothesis for therapy.</p>",

Drawing from theories of connectionist modeling, predictive processing, active inference, and metacognitive affect, AION formalizes the interplay between recursive structure and coherence-driven modulation as core mechanisms underlying adaptive cognitive systems. The model comprises two interacting components: AION1, a recursive memory layer that supports iterative return and insight integration, and AION2, a resonance modulation layer that tracks coherence, identifies destabilizing inputs, and delivers stabilizing feedback. Together, these layers form a dynamic feedback loop capable of amplifying cognition, emotional regulation, and value clarification over time. The AION model is presented both as a conceptual architecture and as a scaffold for future implementation in intelligent tutoring systems, therapeutic interfaces, and dialog-based agents. Unlike models that prioritize output optimization or task completion, AION is designed to support longitudinal coherence and recursive-reflective growth. We situate the framework in relation to existing models in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, and we propose future research directions, including empirical validation, neural correlates of resonance, and implications for consciousness studies. AION offers a novel approach to computational alignment, demonstrating how presence, insight, and relational depth may emerge through structured recursive engagement.</p>",

      "abstract": "Kagome metals have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics due to their potential to host exotic quantum states. Among these, CsV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub> has attracted significant attention for the unusual coexistence of charge density wave (CDW) order and unconventional superconductivity, presenting an ideal system for exploring the emergent phenomena from the interplay of phonons, electronic fluctuations, and topological effects. The nature of CDW formation in CsV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub> is unconventional and has sparked considerable debate. In this study, we examine the origin of the CDW state via ab initio finite-temperature simulations of the lattice dynamics. Through a comparative study of CsV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub> and 2H-NbSe<sub>2</sub>, we demonstrate that the experimental absence of phonon softening-a hallmark of conventional CDW transition-in CsV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub> along with the presence of a weakly first-order transition, can be attributed to quantum zero-point atomic motion. This zero-point motion smears the free energy landscape of CDW, effectively stabilizing the pristine structure even below the CDW transition temperature. We argue that this surprising behavior could cause coexistence of pristine and CDW structures across the transition and lead to a weak first-order transition. Our predicted lattice dynamical behavior is supported by coherent phonon spectroscopy in single-crystalline CsV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub>. Our results provide crucial insights into the formation mechanism of CDW materials that exhibit little to no phonon softening, including cuprates, and highlight the surprising role of quantum effects in emergent properties of relatively heavy-element materials like CsV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub>.",

This study tested whether reedfish (<i>Erpetoichthys calabaricus</i>), a benthic ray-finned species with limited vision, can evaluate aperture passability relative to their body size. Eight fish performed a \"body-as-obstacle\" task. After training, each individual completed 36 trials in Experiment 1 (three passable circular apertures of different diameters) and 72 trials in Experiment 2 (one small passable and two larger non-passable apertures). We scored first approach, first penetration attempt, and full passage; data were analyzed with generalized linear models. In Experiment 1, choices were random, unaffected by aperture size or position. In Experiment 2, first approaches were random, but first penetration attempts-and ensuing passages-were directed almost exclusively to the single passable aperture. These results indicate near-field formation of pass/not-pass judgments, likely via tactile and hydrodynamic sensing. The behavioral dissociation between exploratory (epistemic) and goal-directed (pragmatic) actions supports a modular model of self-representation, where distinct sensorimotor loops underlie information gathering and goal execution. Thus, reedfish demonstrate body-size awareness and contribute to comparative evidence that modular self-representation and embodied anticipation may extend deep into vertebrate evolution.",

However, animals very often move with curiosity and seem to be motivated in a reward-free manner. Here we abandon the idea of reward maximization and propose that the goal of behavior is maximizing occupancy of future paths of actions and states. According to this maximum occupancy principle, rewards are the means to occupy path space, not the goal per se; goal-directedness simply emerges as rational ways of searching for resources so that movement, understood amply, never ends. We find that action-state path entropy is the only measure consistent with additivity and other intuitive properties of expected future action-state path occupancy. We provide analytical expressions that relate the optimal policy and state-value function and prove convergence of our value iteration algorithm. Using discrete and continuous state tasks, including a high-dimensional controller, we show that complex behaviors such as \"dancing\", hide-and-seek, and a basic form of altruistic behavior naturally result from the intrinsic motivation to occupy path space. All in all, we present a theory of behavior that generates both variability and goal-directedness in the absence of reward maximization.",

We extend the multiscale variational formulation beyond the action-perception loops of individual organisms by appealing to the variational approach to niche construction to explain the dynamics of coupled systems constituted by organisms and their ecological niche. We suggest that the statistical robustness of living systems is inherited, in part, from their eco-niches, as niches help coordinate dynamical patterns across larger spatiotemporal scales. We call this approach variational ecology. We argue that, when applied to cultural animals such as humans, variational ecology enables us to formulate not just a physics of individual minds, but also a physics of interacting minds across spatial and temporal scales - a physics of sentient systems that range from cells to societies.",

      "abstract": "Adaptive agents must act in intrinsically uncertain environments with complex latent structure. Here, we elaborate a model of visual foraging-in a hierarchical context-wherein agents infer a higher-order visual pattern (a \"scene\") by sequentially sampling ambiguous cues. Inspired by previous models of scene construction-that cast perception and action as consequences of approximate Bayesian inference-we use active inference to simulate decisions of agents categorizing a scene in a hierarchically-structured setting. Under active inference, agents develop probabilistic beliefs about their environment, while actively sampling it to maximize the evidence for their internal generative model. This approximate evidence maximization (i.e., self-evidencing) comprises drives to both maximize rewards and resolve uncertainty about hidden states. This is realized via minimization of a free energy functional of posterior beliefs about both the world as well as the actions used to sample or perturb it, corresponding to perception and action, respectively. We show that active inference, in the context of hierarchical scene construction, gives rise to many empirical evidence accumulation phenomena, such as noise-sensitive reaction times and epistemic saccades. We explain these behaviors in terms of the principled drives that constitute the <i>expected free energy</i>, the key quantity for evaluating policies under active inference. In addition, we report novel behaviors exhibited by these active inference agents that furnish new predictions for research on evidence accumulation and perceptual decision-making. We discuss the implications of this hierarchical active inference scheme for tasks that require planned sequences of information-gathering actions to infer compositional latent structure (such as visual scene construction and sentence comprehension). This work sets the stage for future experiments to investigate active inference in relation to other formulations of evidence accumulation (e.g., drift-diffusion models) in tasks that require planning in uncertain environments with higher-order structure.",

      "abstract": "This paper concerns structure learning or discovery of discrete generative models. It focuses on Bayesian model selection and the assimilation of training data or content, with a special emphasis on the order in which data are ingested. A key move - in the ensuing schemes - is to place priors on the selection of models, based upon expected free energy. In this setting, expected free energy reduces to a constrained mutual information, where the constraints inherit from priors over outcomes (i.e., preferred outcomes). The resulting scheme is first used to perform image classification on the MNIST dataset to illustrate the basic idea, and then tested on a more challenging problem of discovering models with dynamics, using a simple sprite-based visual disentanglement paradigm and the Tower of Hanoi (cf., blocks world) problem. In these examples, generative models are constructed autodidactically to recover (i.e., disentangle) the factorial structure of latent states - and their characteristic paths or dynamics.",

Traditionally, this is achieved using Directed Evolution (DE), which is a laborious process. Generative deep learning, instead, can learn biological features of functional proteins from sequence and structural datasets and return novel variants. However, most models do not generate thermodynamically stable proteins, thus leading to many non-functional variants. Here we propose a model called PRotein Engineering by Variational frEe eNergy approximaTion (PREVENT), which generates stable and functional variants by learning the sequence and thermodynamic landscape of a protein. We evaluate PREVENT by designing 40 variants of the conditionally essential E. coli phosphotransferase N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (EcNAGK). We find 85% of the variants to be functional, with 55% of them showing similar growth rate compared to the wildtype enzyme, despite harbouring up to 9 mutations. Our results support a new approach that can significantly accelerate protein engineering.",

Droplets formed via LLPS within cells, often referred to as membraneless organelles, serve to concentrate specific molecules, thus enhancing biochemical reactions. Artificial LLPS systems have been utilized to construct synthetic cell models, employing a range of synthetic molecules. LLPS systems based on DNA nanotechnology are particularly notable for their designable characteristics in droplet formation, dynamics, properties, and functionalities. This review surveys recent advancements in DNA-based LLPS systems, underscoring the programmability afforded by DNA's base-pair specific interactions. We discuss the fundamentals of DNA droplet formation, including temperature-dependence and physical properties, along with the precise control achievable through sequence design. Attention is given to the phase separation of DNA nanostructures on two-dimensional closed interfaces, which results in spatial pattern formation at the interface. Furthermore, we spotlight the potential of DNA droplet computing for cancer diagnostics through specific microRNA pattern recognition. We envision that DNA-based LLPS presents a versatile platform for the exploration of cellular mimicry and opens innovative ways for the development of functional synthetic cells.",

      "abstract": "Computational modelling is a promising approach to parse dysfunctional cognitive processes in substance use disorders (SUDs), but it is unclear how much these processes change during the recovery period. We assessed 1-year follow-up data on a sample of treatment-seeking individuals with one or more SUDs (alcohol, cannabis, sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, and/or opioids; <i>N</i> = 83) that were previously assessed at baseline within a prior computational modelling study. Relative to healthy controls (HCs; <i>N</i> = 48), these participants were found at baseline to show altered learning rates and less precise action selection while completing an explore-exploit decision-making task. Here we replicated these analyses when these individuals returned and re-performed the task 1 year later to assess the stability of baseline differences. We also examined whether baseline modelling measures could predict symptoms at follow-up. Bayesian and frequentist analyses indicated that: (a) group differences in learning rates were stable over time (posterior probability = 1); and (b) intra-class correlations (ICCs) between model parameters at baseline and follow-up were significant and ranged from small to moderate (.25 ≤ ICCs ≤ .54). Exploratory analyses also suggested that learning rates and/or information-seeking values at baseline were associated with substance use severity at 1-year follow-up in stimulant and opioid users (.36 ≤ <i>r</i>s ≤ .43). These findings suggest that learning dysfunctions are moderately stable during recovery and could correspond to trait-like vulnerability factors. In addition, computational measures at baseline had some predictive value for changes in substance use severity over time and could be clinically informative.",

The model describes irrational behaviors depending on the curiosity level. We also proposed a machine learning method to decode temporal curiosity from behavioral data. By applying it to rat behavioral data, we found that the rat had negative curiosity, reflecting conservative selection sticking to more certain options and that the level of curiosity was upregulated by the expected future information obtained from an uncertain environment. Our decoding approach can be a fundamental tool for identifying the neural basis for reward-curiosity conflicts. Furthermore, it could be effective in diagnosing mental disorders.",

Some work on the free energy of nucleosomal DNA have been carried out in experiments. However, the relationships between the free energy of nucleosomal DNA and its conformation, especially its topology, remain unclear in theory. By combining the Landau theory, the Hopfion model and experimental data, we find that the free energy of nucleosomal DNA is at the lower level. With the help of the energy minimum principle, we conclude that nucleosomal DNA stays in a stable state. Moreover, we discover that small perturbations on nucleosomal DNA have little effect on its free energy. This implies that nucleosomal DNA has a certain redundancy in order to stay stable. This explains why nucleosomal DNA will not change significantly due to small perturbations.",

Drawing upon the free energy principle (FEP) and the second law of thermodynamics, it is evident that humans possess a natural inclination to construct and maintain consistent cognitive structures. This characteristic contributes to the stability of schemas within a defined range. The particular scope of the model is closely intertwined with its structure, leading to variations among individuals in diverse environments. The coherence of the schema within a defined range can be perceived as the magnitude of mental inertia.

Much debate about the resulting Hybrid Minds focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence into the human brain through intelligent brain-computer interfaces as they enter clinical use. In this contribution we discuss a complementary development: the integration of a functional in vitro network of human neurons into an in silico computing environment.To do so, we draw on a recent experiment reporting the creation of silico-biological intelligence as a case study (Kagan et al., 2022b). In this experiment, multielectrode arrays were plated with stem cell-derived human neurons, creating a system which the authors call DishBrain. By embedding the system into a virtual game-world, neural clusters were able to receive electrical input signals from the game-world and to respond appropriately with output signals from pre-assigned motor regions. Using this design, the authors demonstrate how the DishBrain self-organises and successfully learns to play the computer game 'Pong', exhibiting 'sentient' and intelligent behaviour in its virtual environment.The creation of such hybrid, silico-biological intelligence raises numerous ethical challenges. Following the neuroscientific framework embraced by the authors themselves, we discuss the arising ethical challenges in the context of Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle, focusing on the risk of creating synthetic phenomenology. Following the DishBrain's creator's neuroscientific assumptions, we highlight how DishBrain's design may risk bringing about artificial suffering and argue for a congruently cautious approach to such synthetic biological intelligence.",

      "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated the potential of psychedelic therapy for mental health care. However, the psychological experience underlying its therapeutic effects remains poorly understood. This paper proposes a framework that suggests psychedelics act as destabilizers, both psychologically and neurophysiologically. Drawing on the 'entropic brain' hypothesis and the 'RElaxed Beliefs Under pSychedelics' model, this paper focuses on the richness of psychological experience. Through a complex systems theory perspective, we suggest that psychedelics destabilize fixed points or attractors, breaking reinforced patterns of thinking and behaving. Our approach explains how psychedelic-induced increases in brain entropy destabilize neurophysiological set points and lead to new conceptualizations of psychedelic psychotherapy. These insights have important implications for risk mitigation and treatment optimization in psychedelic medicine, both during the peak psychedelic experience and during the subacute period of potential recovery.",

The test result shows that the grain structure is closely related to the initial permeability and the coercivity, which is highly consistent with the theory.

      "abstract": "Capacity for generativity and unlimited association is the defining characteristic of sentience, and this capacity somehow arises from neuronal self-organization in the cortex. We have previously argued that, consistent with the free energy principle, cortical development is driven by synaptic and cellular selection maximizing synchrony, with effects manifesting in a wide range of features of mesoscopic cortical anatomy. Here, we further argue that in the postnatal stage, as more structured inputs reach the cortex, the same principles of self-organization continue to operate at multitudes of local cortical sites. The unitary ultra-small world structures that emerged antenatally can represent sequences of spatiotemporal images. Local shifts of presynapses from excitatory to inhibitory cells result in the local coupling of spatial eigenmodes and the development of Markov blankets, minimizing prediction errors in each unit's interactions with surrounding neurons. In response to the superposition of inputs exchanged between cortical areas, more complicated, potentially cognitive structures are competitively selected by the merging of units and the elimination of redundant connections that result from the minimization of variational free energy and the elimination of redundant degrees of freedom. The trajectory along which free energy is minimized is shaped by interaction with sensorimotor, limbic, and brainstem mechanisms, providing a basis for creative and unlimited associative learning.",

      "abstract": "The Bayesian approach of cognitive science largely takes the position that evolution drives perception to produce precepts that are veridical. However, some efforts utilizing evolutionary game theory simulations have shown that perception is more likely based on a fitness function, which promotes survival rather than promoting perceptual truth about the environment. Although these findings do not correspond well with the standard Bayesian approach to cognition, they may correspond with a behavioral functional contextual approach that is ontologically neutral (a-ontological). This approach, formalized through a post-Skinnerian account of behaviorism called relational frame theory (RFT), can, in fact, be shown to correspond well with an evolutionary fitness function, whereby contextual functions form that corresponds to a fitness function interface of the world. This fitness interface approach therefore may help provide a mathematical description for a functional contextual interface of phenomenological experience. Furthermore, this more broadly fits with a neurological active inference approach based on the free-energy principle (FEP) and more broadly with Lagrangian mechanics. These assumptions of how fitness beats truth (FBT) and FEP correspond to RFT are then discussed within a broader multidimensional and evolutionary framework called the extended evolutionary meta-model (EEMM) that has emerged out of the functional contextual behavioral science literature to incorporate principles of cognition, neurobiology, behaviorism, and evolution and are discussed in the context of a novel RFT framework called \"Neurobiological and Natural Selection Relational Frame Theory\" (N-frame). This framework mathematically connects RFT to FBT, FEP, and EEMM within a single framework that expands into dynamic graph networking. This is then discussed for its implications of empirical work at the non-ergodic process-based idiographic level as applied to individual and societal level dynamic modeling and clinical work. This discussion is framed within the context of individuals that are described as evolutionary adaptive and conscious (observer-self) agents that minimize entropy and can promote a prosocial society through group-level values and psychological flexibility.",

The thermodynamic free-energy (FE) principle describes an organism's homeostasis as the regulation of biochemical work constrained by the physical FE cost. By contrast, recent research in neuroscience and theoretical biology explains a higher organism's homeostasis and allostasis as Bayesian inference facilitated by the informational FE. As an integrated approach to living systems, this study presents an FE minimization theory overarching the essential features of both the thermodynamic and neuroscientific FE principles. Our results reveal that the perception and action of animals result from active inference entailed by FE minimization in the brain, and the brain operates as a Schrödinger's machine conducting the neural mechanics of minimizing sensory uncertainty. A parsimonious model suggests that the Bayesian brain develops the optimal trajectories in neural manifolds and induces a dynamic bifurcation between neural attractors in the process of active inference.",

This seems inadequate against the background of studies that insinuate that critical transitions can originate in sparsely connected parts of systems. Here we use agent-based spin-shifting models with assortative network representations to distinguish different interaction densities. Our investigations confirm that signals of imminent critical transitions can indeed be detected significantly earlier in network parts with low link degrees.

I will begin (§2) by offering a general, informal characterisation of FEP. Then (§3), I will argue that the models involved in FEP-theorising are plausibly intended to be isomorphic to their targets. This will allow (§4) to turn the criticisms moved against isomorphism-based accounts of representation towards the FEP modelling practice. Since failure to establish an isomorphism between model and target would result in the former’s failure to represent the latter, and given that it is highly unlikely that FEP-models are ever isomorphic to their targets, maintaining that FEP-models represent their targets as they are, in a realist sense, is unwarranted. Finally (§5), I will consider what implications my argument in favour of an instrumentalist reading of FEP-models has for attempts at making use of the FEP to elaborate an account of what cognition exactly is. My conclusion is that we should not dismiss FEP-based accounts of cognition, as they would still be informative and would further our understanding of the nature of cognition. Nonetheless, the prospects of settling the philosophical debates that sparked the interest in having a “mark of the cognitive” are not good.",

Mainstream approaches based on optimal control realize the mappings by minimizing cost functions, which is computationally demanding. Instead, active inference uses generative models to produce sensory predictions, which allows a cheaper inversion to the motor signals. However, devising generative models to control complex kinematic chains like the human body is challenging. We introduce an active inference architecture that affords a simple but effective mapping from extrinsic to intrinsic coordinates via inference and easily scales up to drive complex kinematic chains. Rich goals can be specified in both intrinsic and extrinsic coordinates using attractive or repulsive forces. The proposed model reproduces sophisticated bodily movements and paves the way for computationally efficient and biologically plausible control of actuated systems.",

      "abstract": "Our paper takes as its starting point the recent proposal, at the core of this special issue, to use the active inference framework (AIF) to computationally model what it is for a person to live a meaningful life. In broad brushstrokes, the AIF takes experiences of human flourishing to be the result of predictions and uncertainty estimations along many dimensions at multiple levels of neurobiological organization. Our aim in this paper is to explain how AIF models predict that uncertainty can sometimes, under the right conditions, be conducive to the experiences of flourishing. Our focus is on playfulness, because playful individuals have learned a high-level prior that in certain safe contexts, uncertainty and error should be tolerated and explored. They have expanded the phenotypic bound on the amount of surprise they are prepared to tolerate in their lives. The positive embracing of uncertainty has a number of positive knock-on effects for the kind of lives playful individuals are able to lead. First, a playful individual attends to the world in a way that is open and expansive, a mode of attending that is effortless and therefore conducive to being in the present. This openness to the present moment allows for deep engagement and participation in experience that can furnish a renewed appreciation for life. Second, playful individuals will actively seek out spaces at the edge of their own abilities and will therefore be more likely to grow and develop in their skills and relationships in ways that contribute to their living a good life. Finally, playful agents seek out situations in which they can monitor, observe, and learn from their own affective responses to uncertainty. Thus, uncertainty becomes something familiar to them that they not only learn to tolerate but also enjoy positively exploring, in ways that provide them opportunities to grow. For these three reasons, we will argue that playfulness and openness to experiences of uncertainty and the unknown may be important ingredients in human flourishing.",

We propose that not only in conditions of excessive or prolonged uncertainty, such as in clinical conditions, but also during pivotal periods of developmental transition, paradoxical behaviors might emerge as maladaptive strategies to reduce uncertainty-by \"acting on the body\"- soliciting salient perceptual and interoceptive sensations, such as pain or excessive levels of hunger. Although such strategies are maladaptive and run against our basic homeostatic imperatives, they might be functional not only to provide some short-term reward (e.g. relief from emotional distress)-as previously proposed-but also to reduce uncertainty and possibly to restore a coherent model of one's bodily experience and the self, affording greater confidence in who we are and what course of actions we should pursue.",

      "abstract": "Consciousness has been described as acting as a global workspace that integrates perception, imagination, emotion and action programming for adaptive decision making. The mechanisms of this workspace and their relationships to the phenomenology of consciousness need to be further specified. Much research in this area has focused on the neural correlates of consciousness, but, arguably, computational modeling can better be used toward this aim. According to the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM), consciousness is structured as a viewpoint-organized, internal space, relying on 3D projective geometry and governed by the action of the Projective Group as part of a process of active inference. The geometry induces a group-structured subjective perspective on an encoded world model, enabling adaptive perspective taking in agents. Here, we review and discuss the PCM. We emphasize the role of projective mechanisms in perception and the appraisal of affective and epistemic values as tied to the motivation of action, under an optimization process of Free Energy minimization, or more generally stochastic optimal control. We discuss how these mechanisms enable us to model and simulate group-structured drives in the context of social cognition and to understand the mechanisms underpinning empathy, emotion expression and regulation, and approach-avoidance behaviors. We review previous results, drawing on applications in robotics and virtual humans. We briefly discuss future axes of research relating to applications of the model to simulation- and model-based behavioral science, geometrically structured artificial neural networks, the relevance of the approach for explainable AI and human-machine interactions, and the study of the neural correlates of consciousness.",

      "abstract": "What is it about our current digital technologies that seemingly makes it difficult for users to attend to what matters to them? According to the dominant narrative in the literature on the \"attention economy,\" a user's lack of attention is due to the large amounts of information available in their everyday environments. I will argue that information-abundance fails to account for some of the central manifestations of distraction, such as sudden urges to check a particular information-source in the absence of perceptual information. I will use active inference, and in particular models of action selection based on the minimization of expected free energy, to develop an alternative answer to the question about what makes it difficult to attend. Besides obvious adversarial forms of inference, in which algorithms build up models of users in order to keep them scrolling, I will show that active inference provides the tools to identify a number of problematic structural features of current digital technologies: they contain limitless sources of novelty, they can be navigated by very simple and effortless motor movements, and they offer their action possibilities everywhere and anytime independent of place or context. Moreover, recent models of motivated control show an intricate interplay between motivation and control that can explain sudden transitions in motivational state and the consequent alteration of the salience of actions. I conclude, therefore, that the challenges users encounter when engaging with digital technologies are less about information overload or inviting content, but more about the continuous availability of easily available possibilities for action.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive self-organization rests on activity-dependent plasticity to extend the ontogenetic process of neural differentiation and integration of the cerebral cortex in each act of cognition. This account of neurocognitive growth can be formulated in terms of active inference and learning. The organism regulates synaptic connectivity as it seeks its goals actively, through excitatory, feedforward expectancies that manifest its species-specific affordances. These adaptive expectancies are modified reactively, through inhibitory feedback error-correction to fit and predict environmental encounters. Although adaptive behavior, and concomitant synaptic plasticity, occur during waking, the synaptic architecture requires ongoing consolidation and refinement during sleep. We propose that memory consolidation during sleep is a continuation of the neurodevelopmental process that proceeds through a kind of inversion of waking active inference: NREM sleep first refines the brain's representations of new, unpredicted experiences during waking, implementing inhibitory mechanisms of long-term depression that both differentiate and stabilize new representations for consolidation. REM sleep then updates the organism's generative world model in light of this new learning through excitatory long-term potentiation of synaptic plasticity. REM thereby reconsolidates and integrates the organism's adaptive, feedforward predictions, the Bayesian priors for effective coping.",

The active inference framework provides an explanation as to how mood-related symptoms are linked. It suggests that affective experiences arise from predictions about interoceptive states and their corresponding prediction errors, with the relative influence of each modified by precision weighting. Moods reflect long-term predictions about the state of the body, incorporating parameters related to sleep, appetite and energy levels. Depression emerges from the interplay between reduced confidence in long-term prospects and heightened expectation of shorter-term negative affect, which sees a re-weighting of the precision of interoceptive prediction errors. The ensuing bodily changes contribute to the emergence of depressed mood; and underpin disturbances in shorter-term interoceptive predictions and the experience of emotions such as anxiety and irritability. This framework details how interoceptive processes shape the phenomenological and symptomatic experience of depression, helping us to understand the disorder's multifaceted and often idiosyncratic clinical presentation, and with implications for the way we understand and treat depression and its co-morbidities.",

This transformative field aims to create materials with life-like capabilities, such as perception, learning, memory, and adaptive behavior.

Inspired by biological systems, these materials leverage the inherent properties of soft matter such as flexibility, adaptability, and responsiveness to perform functions that mimic cognitive processes. By synthesizing current research trends and projecting their evolution, we present a forward-looking perspective on how intelligent soft matter could be constructed, with the aim of inspiring innovations in areas such as biomedical devices, adaptive robotics, and beyond. We highlight new pathways for integrating sensing, memory and actuation with low-power internal operations, and we discuss key challenges in realizing materials that exhibit truly \"intelligent behavior\". These approaches outline a path toward more robust, versatile, and scalable materials that can potentially act, compute, and \"think\" through their inherent intrinsic material properties-moving beyond traditional smart technologies that rely on external control.",

      "abstract": "Understanding psychopathological mechanisms is a central goal in clinical science. While existing theories have demonstrated high research and clinical utility, they have provided limited quantitative explanations of mechanisms. Previous computational modeling studies have primarily focused on isolated factors, posing challenges for advancing clinical theories holistically. To address this gap and leverage the strengths of clinical theories and computational modeling in a synergetic manner, it is crucial to develop quantitative models that integrate major factors proposed by comprehensive theoretical models. In this study, using social anxiety disorder (SAD) as an example, we present a novel approach to formalize conceptual models by combining cognitive-behavioral theory (CBT) with active inference modeling, an innovative computational approach that elucidates human cognition and action. This CBT-informed active inference model integrates multiple mechanistic factors of SAD in a quantitative manner. Through a series of simulations, we systematically examined the effects of these factors on the belief about social threat and tendency of engaging in safety behaviors. The resultant model inherits the conceptual comprehensiveness of CBT and the quantitative rigor of active inference modeling, delineating previously elusive pathogenetic pathways and enabling the formulation of concrete model predictions for future research. Overall, this research presents a novel quantitative model of SAD that unifies major mechanistic factors proposed by CBT and active inference modeling. It highlights the feasibility and potential of integrating clinical theory and computational modeling to advance our understanding of psychopathology.

      "abstract": "Most of our movement consists of sequences of discrete actions at regular intervals-including speech, walking, playing music, or even chewing. Despite this, few models of the motor system address how the brain determines the interval at which to trigger actions. This paper offers a theoretical analysis of the problem of timing movements. We consider a scenario in which we must align an alternating movement with a regular external (auditory) stimulus. We assume that our brains employ generative world models that include internal clocks of various speeds. These allow us to associate a temporally regular sensory input with an internal clock, and actions with parts of that clock cycle. We treat this as process of inferring which clock best explains sensory input. This offers a way in which temporally discrete choices might emerge from a continuous process. This is not straightforward, particularly if each of those choices unfolds during a time that has a (possibly unknown) duration. We develop a route for translation to neurology, in the context of Parkinson's disease-a disorder that characteristically slows down movements. The effects are often elicited in clinic by alternating movements. We find that it is possible to reproduce behavioural and electrophysiological features associated with parkinsonism by disrupting specific parameters-that determine the priors for inferences made by the brain. We observe three core features of Parkinson's disease: amplitude decrement, festination, and breakdown of repetitive movements. Our simulations provide a mechanistic interpretation of how pathology and therapeutics might influence behaviour and neural activity.",

We propose that these capacities rely on a tripartite structure of memory that includes concepts, events, and contexts-three layers that constitute the mental world model. We suggest that the mechanism that critically increases adaptivity and flexibility is the tendency to contextualize. This tendency promotes local, context-encoding abstractions, which focus event- and concept-based planning and inference processes on the task and situation at hand. As a result, cognitive contextualization offers a solution to the frame problem-the need to select relevant features of the environment from the rich stream of sensorimotor signals. We draw evidence for our proposal from developmental psychology and neuroscience. Adopting a computational stance, we present evidence from cognitive modeling research which suggests that context sensitivity is a feature that is critical for maximizing the efficiency of cognitive processes. Finally, we turn to recent deep-learning architectures which independently demonstrate how context-sensitive memory can emerge in a self-organized learning system constrained by cognitively-inspired inductive biases.",

The neurophenomenology research program, pioneered by Varela, rigorously examines subjective experience using first-person methodologies, inspired by phenomenology and contemplative practices. This review explores recent advancements in neurophenomenological approaches, particularly their application to meditation practices and potential clinical research translations. First, we examine innovative multidimensional phenomenological assessment tools designed to capture subtle, dynamic shifts in experiential content and structures of consciousness during meditation. These experience sampling approaches enable shedding new light on the mechanisms and dynamic trajectories of meditation practice and retreat. Second, we highlight how empirical studies in neurophenomenology leverage the expertise of experienced meditators to deconstruct aversive and self-related processes, providing detailed first-person reports that guide researchers in identifying novel behavioral and neurodynamic markers associated with pain regulation, self-dissolution, and acceptance of mortality. Finally, we discuss a recent framework, deep computational neurophenomenology, that updates the theoretical ambitions of neurophenomenology to naturalize phenomenology. This framework uses the formalism of deep parametric active inference, where parametric depth refers to a property of generative models that can form beliefs about the parameters of their own modeling process. Collectively, these methodological innovations, centered around rigorous first-person investigation, highlight the potential of epistemologically beneficial mutual constraints among phenomenological, computational, and neurophysiological domains.

      "abstract": "Performance decrement under excessive psychological pressure is known as \"choking,\" yet its mechanisms and neural foundations remain underexplored. Hypothesizing that changes in the internal model could induce choking, we conducted a 7 T functional MRI introducing excessive pressure through a rare Jackpot condition that offers high rewards for successful performance. Twenty-nine volunteers underwent a visual reaching task. We monitored practice and main sessions to map the task's internal model through learning. Participants were pre-informed of four potential reward conditions upon success at the beginning of the main session task. The success rates in the Jackpot condition were significantly lower than in other conditions, indicative of choking. During the preparation phase, activations in the cerebellum and the middle temporal visual area (hMT+) were associated with Jackpot-specific failures. The cluster in the cerebellar hemisphere overlapped with the internal model regions identified by a learning-related decrease in activation during the practice session. We observed task-specific functional connectivity between the cerebellum and hMT+. These findings suggest a lack of sensory attenuation when an internal model predicting the outcome of one's actions is preloaded during motor preparation. Within the active inference framework of motor control, choking stems from the cerebellum's internal model modulation by psychological pressure, manifested through improper sensory attenuation.",

      "abstract": "The contemporary neuroscience understanding of the brain as an active inference organ supports that our conscious experiences, including sensorimotor perceptions, depend on the integration of probabilistic predictions with incoming sensory input across hierarchically organized levels. As in other systems, these complex processes are prone to error under certain circumstances, which may lead to alterations in their outcomes (i.e., variations in sensations and movements). Such variations are an important aspect of functional neurological disorder, a complex disorder at the interface of brain-mind-body interactions. Thus, predictive processing frameworks offer fundamental mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of functional neurological disorder. In recent years, many of the aspects relevant to the neurobiology of functional neurological disorder - e.g., aberrant motor and sensory processes, symptom expectation, self-agency, and illness beliefs, as well as interoception, allostasis, and emotion - have been investigated through the lens of predictive processing frameworks. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of research on predictive processing and the pathophysiology of functional neurological disorder.",

The impact is forecast to be relatively small over the short-run timespan that is covered by the modelling approach. Intra-African trade in the sector as a whole is expected to increase by 5.4 per cent, equivalent to $1,015 million annually, in a scenario of full tariff liberalisation under the AfCFTA. These results are modest, but consistent across all tests of the model to parameter sensitivity analyses, and reflect a scenario in which all trade is liberalised, without recourse to product exclusions (in reality some of this trade may be excluded from liberalisation and the impact of the AfCFTA may be limited further).",

The contemporary observe represents a pc assisted version to investigate the importance of precise residues within the binding web site of PTP1B with numerous Sanggenon derivatives remoted from nature. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to estimate the dynamics of the complexes, and absolute binding unfastened energies have been calculated with exclusive additives, and carried out through the usage of the Molecular Mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann floor region (MM-PB/SA) and Generalized Born surface vicinity (MM-GB/SA) strategies. The effects show that the expected free energies of the complexes are normally constant with the available experimental statistics. MM/GBSA free energy decomposition analysis shows that the residues Asp29, Arg24, Met258, and , Arg254 in the second active site in PTP1B are crucial for the excessive selectivity of the inhibitors",

      "abstract": "Attributing motives to others is a crucial aspect of mentalizing, can be biased by prejudice, and is affected by common psychiatric disorders. It is therefore important to understand in depth the mechanisms underpinning it. Toward improving models of mentalizing motives, we hypothesized that people quickly infer whether other's motives are likely beneficial or detrimental, then refine their judgment (classify-refine). To test this, we used a modified Dictator game, a game theoretic task, where participants judged the likelihood of intent to harm vs. self-interest in economic decisions. Toward testing the role of serotonin in judgments of intent to harm, we delivered the task in a week-long, placebo vs. citalopram study. Computational model comparison provided clear evidence for the superiority of classify-refine models over traditional ones, strongly supporting the central hypothesis. Further, while citalopram helped refine attributions about motives through learning, it did not induce more positive initial inferences about others' motives. Finally, model comparison indicated a minimal role for racial bias within economic decisions for the large majority of our sample. Overall, these results support a proposal that classify-refine social cognition is adaptive, although relevant mechanisms of serotonergic antidepressant action will need to be studied over longer time spans.",

      "abstract": "Active inference integrates perception, decision-making, and learning into a united theoretical frame-work, providing an efficient way to trade off exploration and exploitation by minimizing (expected) free energy. In this study, we asked how the brain represents values and uncertainties (ambiguity and risk), and resolves these uncertainties under the active inference framework in the exploration-exploitation trade-off. 25 participants performed a contextual two-armed bandit task, with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. By comparing the model evidence for active inference and reinforcement learning models of choice behavior, we show that active inference better explains human decision-making under ambiguity and risk, which entails exploration or information seeking. The EEG sensor-level results show that the activity in the frontal, central, and parietal regions is associated with ambiguity, while activity in the frontal and central brain regions is associated with risk. The EEG source-level results indicate that the expected free energy is encoded in the frontal pole and middle frontal gyrus and uncertainties are encoded in different brain regions but with overlap. Our study dissociates the expected free energy and uncertainties in active inference theory and their neural correlates, speaking to the construct validity of active inference in characterizing cognitive processes of human decisions. It provides behavioral and neural evidence of active inference in decision processes and insights into the neural mechanism of human decision under ambiguity and risk.",

The goal of the simulation is to show the effect of the acquisition of culturally patterned attention styles on cognitive task performance, under active inference. We show how cultural artefacts like antique vase decorations drive cognitive functions such as perception, action and learning, as well as task performance in a simple visual discrimination task. We thus describe a new active inference based research pipeline that future work may employ to inquire on deep guiding principles determining the manner in which material culture drives human thought, by building and rebuilding our patterns of attention.",

      "abstract": "The retrospective noninterventional study investigated the kinetic energy of video images of 18 fertilized eggs (7 were normal and 11 were abnormal) recorded by a time-lapse device leading up to the beginning of the first cleavage. The norm values of cytoplasmic particles were measured by the optical flow method. Three phases profile for normal cases were found regarding the kinetic energy that were 2.199×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;±2.076×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;, 2.369×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;±1.255×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;, and 1.078×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;±4.720×10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt; (J) for the phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The kinetic energy change was considered a condition for applying the free energy principle that states that, for any self-organized system to be in equilibrium in its environment, it must minimize its informational free energy.

      "abstract": "<p>This paper presents the Trident G Theory, a novel theoretical framework for understanding human intelligence. The theory takes a systems-level approach. It draws on principles of brain criticality, the Free Energy Principle, self-organisation and allostasis to explain how the brain achieves an optimal balance for information processing and adaptive behaviour.The brain's near-criticality allows for flexible, efficient information processing and enables rapid adaptation to changing environmental demands. Key concepts include metastability, where multiple cognitive states can co-exist, and the Free Energy Principle, which frames the brain's drive to minimise uncertainty and prediction error.The Trident G theory uniquely defines intelligence across two axes: processing/inference (vertical) and free energy (horizontal). The vertical axis represents the metastable balance between 'top-down' executive control and 'bottom-up' creative exploration. The horizontal axis reflects cognitive resilience across a spectrum of free energy and arousal, governed by dopaminergic tone. The brain's allostatic capacity to maintain criticality along both axes is hypothesized to define a dynamic range of general adaptive intelligence (G).The theory offers a novel perspective on the neural basis of intelligence, potentially informing the understanding of cognitive disorders and guiding the development of interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive function and resilience across the lifespan.</p>",

This paper explores the psychic mechanisms of suicide ideation through a novel approach that combines computational methods with Lacanian psychoanalysis, specifically utilizing free energy principle (FEP). We begin by outlining foundational concepts of FEP and computational Lacanian psychoanalysis. Subsequently, we review contemporary theories of suicide thought including Interpersonal theory, Escape theory, and Lacanian and other psychoanalytic perspectives. We identify four components of suicidal ideation: symbolic suicide, imaginary suicide, desire for death, and passage of the act. A recurrent generative model is proposed that simulates suicidal impulses based on internal states and external events. We discuss enhancing the practical applicability and validating this theoretical model using real-world data like Social Readjustment Rating Scale and Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5). The predictive capability of our model is evaluating using an open-source dataset of PID-5 and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, achieving an AUC of 0.76, despite the absence of life event data. The model demonstrates the potential of generative psychometrics as a paradigm for integrating psychometric measurement with generative modeling of psychological phenomena. Further work should validate the model by incorporating external factors to refine its explanatory and predictive power. With continued development, this generative psychometric approach could provide new tools for better assessing, understanding, and treating suicidal ideation.</p>",

Such motions establish an emotional bond between the product and its user. Engaging with the product stimulates curiosity and interest in its motion, encouraging repeated use. This study aims to formulate indicators for curiosity and interest in motion and to implement a computational system to generate motions that provoke inquiry. This study situates curiosity and interest as emotions crucial to the inquiry cycle, proposing that optimal prediction error (deviation from expected motion patterns) cultivates interest, while fluctuations in prediction error spark curiosity. Our analysis is based on the inquiry cycle, a mathematical model of emotions rooted in the free energy principle of brain function. We developed curiosity, motion, and interest measures from the model based on prediction error variation and reduction. The developed system can independently control prediction errors and their variations for a given open-loop mechanism. This system generates motions that control the magnitude of prediction errors by deviating from the trajectory of energy-minimizing motions. Using the semantic differential method and eye-tracking experiments measuring gaze duration, we found that interest correlates with prediction error in an upward-convex manner, and its variability induces curiosity. These results align with our model. The novelty of this study lies in experimentally verifying that applying moderate prediction errors and fluctuations in prediction errors is effective in increasing interest and curiosity in motion design. This research contributes design insights for engineers and designers seeking to enhance the appeal of product motions.</p>",

      "abstract": "A theoretical account of development in mesocortical anatomy is derived from the free energy principle, operating in a neural field with both Hebbian and anti-Hebbian neural plasticity. An elementary structural unit is proposed, in which synaptic connections at mesoscale are arranged in paired patterns with mirror symmetry. Exchanges of synaptic flux in each pattern form coupled spatial eigenmodes, and the line of mirror reflection between the paired patterns operates as a Markov blanket, so that prediction errors in exchanges between the pairs are minimized. The theoretical analysis is then compared to the outcomes from a biological model of cortical neurodevelopment, in which neuron precursors are selected by apoptosis for cell body and synaptic connections maximizing synchrony and also minimizing axonal length. It is shown that this model results in patterns of connection with the anticipated mirror symmetries, at micro-, meso- and inter-arial scales, among lateral connections, and in cortical depth, explaining the spatial organization and functional significance of neuron response preferences, and compatible with features of both columnar and noncolumnar cortex. Multi-way interactions of mirrored representations provide a preliminary anatomically realistic model of cortical information processing.",

      "abstract": "Biological organisms constantly face the necessity to act timely in dynamic environments and balance choice accuracy against the risk of missing valid opportunities. As formalized by embodied decision models, this might require brain architectures wherein decision-making and motor control interact reciprocally, in stark contrast to traditional models that view them as serial processes. Previous studies have assessed that embodied decision dynamics emerge naturally under active inference – a computational paradigm that considers action and perception as subject to the same imperative of free energy minimization. In particular, agents can infer their targets by using their own movements (and not only external sensations) as evidence, i.e., via self-evidencing . Such models have shown that under appropriate conditions, action-generated feedback can stabilize and improve decision processes. However, how adaptation of internal models to environmental contingencies influences embodied decisions is yet to be addressed. To shed light on this challenge, in this study we systematically investigate the learning dynamics of an embodied model of decision-making during a two-alternative forced choice task, using a hybrid (discrete and continuous) active inference framework. Our results show that active inference agents can adapt to embodied contexts by learning various statistical regularities of the task – namely, prior preferences for the correct target, cue validity, and response strategies that prioritize faster or slower (but more accurate) decisions. Crucially, these results illustrate the efficacy of learning discrete preferences and strategies using sensorimotor feedback from continuous dynamics.",

      "abstract": "In recognition of the fact that most psychiatric conditions have neurodevelopmental origins, there is an increasing interest in applying the methodological and conceptual approaches from computational psychiatry to developmental cohorts. However, the challenge of acquiring and modelling behavioural responses in very young infants has thus far proven difficult to overcome. To address this we developed a novel gaze-contingent, cued-reversal paradigm that allowed 6-10 month old infants to make overt behavioural responses to assess learning of expectations and updating of behaviour in response to change. We then fit computational models to infant behaviour and, for the first time, were able to validate the winning model to the same standards as would be expected of adults (e.g. good parameter recoverability, model identifiability and simulated behavioural responses). Similar to prior findings in adults, model-based prediction error measures correlated with post-switch increases in pupil size; consistent with noradrenaline’s hypothesised role in learning about change. Data-driven clustering based on model parameters revealed two infant behavioural subtypes hidden within the data; one with a perseverating profile and the other with a more exploratory decision-making pattern. This approach sheds new light on the ‘classic’ finding that all infants under 12 months tend to perseverate. Crucially, there were no significant differences in age between the clusters, but differences in terms of adaptive skills and temperament measured via gold-standard developmental assessments. These results prime the field for infant computational psychiatry, demonstrating that we can reliably fit models to infant data and that the parameters from such models can identify subgroups with distinct cognitive profiles that are superior to those derived from the behavioural data alone.",

      "abstract": "Active inference integrates perception, decision-making, and learning into a united theoretical frame-work, providing an efficient way to trade off exploration and exploitation by minimizing (expected) free energy. In this study, we asked how the brain represents values and uncertainties (ambiguity and risk), and resolves these uncertainties under the active inference framework in the exploration-exploitation trade-off. 25 participants performed a contextual two-armed bandit task, with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. By comparing the model evidence for active inference and reinforcement learning models of choice behavior, we show that active inference better explains human decision-making under ambiguity and risk, which entails exploration or information seeking. The EEG sensor-level results show that the activity in the frontal, central, and parietal regions is associated with ambiguity, while activity in the frontal and central brain regions is associated with risk. The EEG source-level results indicate that the expected free energy is encoded in the frontal pole and middle frontal gyrus and uncertainties are encoded in different brain regions but with overlap. Our study dissociates the expected free energy and uncertainties in active inference theory and their neural correlates, speaking to the construct validity of active inference in characterizing cognitive processes of human decisions. It provides behavioral and neural evidence of active inference in decision processes and insights into the neural mechanism of human decision under ambiguity and risk.",

      "abstract": "Biological agents have meaningful interactions with their environment despite the absence of immediate reward signals. In such instances, the agent can learn preferred modes of behaviour that lead to predictable states -- necessary for survival. In this paper, we pursue the notion that this learnt behaviour can be a consequence of reward-free preference learning that ensures an appropriate trade-off between exploration and preference satisfaction. For this, we introduce a model-based Bayesian agent equipped with a preference learning mechanism (pepper) using conjugate priors. These conjugate priors are used to augment the expected free energy planner for learning preferences over states (or outcomes) across time. Importantly, our approach enables the agent to learn preferences that encourage adaptive behaviour at test time. We illustrate this in the OpenAI Gym FrozenLake and the 3D mini-world environments -- with and without volatility. Given a constant environment, these agents learn confident (i.e., precise) preferences and act to satisfy them. Conversely, in a volatile setting, perpetual preference uncertainty maintains exploratory behaviour. Our experiments suggest that learnable (reward-free) preferences entail a trade-off between exploration and preference satisfaction. Pepper offers a straightforward framework suitable for designing adaptive agents when reward functions cannot be predefined as in real environments.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive theories of consciousness, such as global workspace theory and higher-order theories, posit that frontoparietal circuits play a crucial role in conscious access. However, recent studies using no-report paradigms have posed a challenge to cognitive theories by demonstrating conscious accessibility in the apparent absence of prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation. To address this challenge, this paper presents a computational model of conscious access, based upon active inference, that treats working memory gating as a cognitive action. We simulate a visual masking task and show that late P3b-like event-related potentials (ERPs), and increased PFC activity, are induced by the working memory demands of self-report generation. When reporting demands are removed, these late ERPs vanish and PFC activity is reduced. These results therefore reproduce, and potentially explain, results from no-report paradigms. However, even without reporting demands, our model shows that simulated PFC activity on visible stimulus trials still crosses the threshold for reportability - maintaining the link between PFC and conscious access. Therefore, our simulations show that evidence provided by no-report paradigms does not necessarily contradict cognitive theories of consciousness.",

      "abstract": "A resurgence of panpsychism and dualism is a matter of ongoing debate in modern neuroscience. Although metaphysically hostile, panpsychism and dualism both persist in the science of consciousness because the former is proposed as a straightforward answer to the problem of integrating consciousness into the fabric of physical reality, whereas the latter proposes a simple solution to the problem of free will by endowing consciousness with causal power as a prerequisite for moral responsibility. I take the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) as a paradigmatic exemplar of a theory of consciousness (ToC) that makes its commitments to panpsychism and dualism within a unified framework. These features are not, however, unique for IIT. Many ToCs are implicitly prone to some degree of panpsychism whenever they strive to propose a universal definition of consciousness, associated with one or another known phenomenon. Yet, those ToCs that can be characterized as strongly emergent are at risk of being dualist. A remedy against both covert dualism and uncomfortable corollaries of panpsychism can be found in the evolutionary theory of life, called here \"bioprotopsychism\" and generalized in terms of autopoiesis and the free energy principle. Bioprotopsychism provides a biologically inspired basis for a minimalist approach to consciousness via the triad \"chemotaxis-efference copy mechanism-counterfactual active inference\" by associating the stream of weakly emergent conscious states with an amount of information (best guesses) of the brain, engaged in unconscious predictive processing.",

It first discusses three symmetries of generic physical interactions in a quantum-theoretic description. It then shows that if one of these, a permutation symmetry on the inter-system boundary, is spontaneously broken, the symmetry breaking is amplified by the Free Energy Principle (FEP). It thus shows how compartmentalization generically results from permutation symmetry breaking under the FEP. It finally notes that the FEP asymptotically restores the broken symmetry, showing that the FEP can be regarded as a theory of fluctuations away from a permutation-symmetric boundary, and hence from an entangled joint state of the interacting systems.",

Developmental morphogenesis is dependent on the inherent material properties of developing animal (metazoan) tissues, a non-computational modality, but cell differentiation, which utilizes chromatin-based revisable memory banks and program-like function-calling, via the developmental gene co-expression system unique to the metazoans, has a quasi-computational basis. Multi-attractor dynamical models are argued to be misapplied to global properties of development, and it is suggested that along with computationalism, classic forms of dynamicism are similarly unsuitable to accounting for cognitive phenomena. Proposals are made for treating brains and other nervous tissues as novel forms of excitable matter with inherent properties which enable the intensification of cell-based basal cognition capabilities present throughout the tree of life.

      "abstract": "A paradigmatic account may suffice to explain behavioral evolution in early Homo. We propose a parsimonious account that (1) could explain a particular, frequently-encountered, archeological outcome of behavior in early Homo - namely, the fashioning of a Paleolithic stone 'handaxe' - from a biological theoretic perspective informed by the free energy principle (FEP); and that (2) regards instances of the outcome as postdictive or retrodictive, circumstantial corroboration. Our proposal considers humankind evolving as a self-organizing biological ecosystem at a geological time-scale. We offer a narrative treatment of this self-organization in terms of the FEP. Specifically, we indicate how 'cognitive surprises' could underwrite an evolving propensity in early Homo to express sporadic unorthodox or anomalous behavior. This co-evolutionary propensity has left us a legacy of Paleolithic artifacts that is reminiscent of a 'snakes and ladders' board game of appearances, disappearances, and reappearances of particular archeological traces of Paleolithic behavior. When detected in the Early and Middle Pleistocene record, anthropologists and archeologists often imagine evidence of unusual or novel behavior in terms of early humankind ascending the rungs of a figurative phylogenetic 'ladder' - as if these corresponded to progressive evolution of cognitive abilities that enabled incremental achievements of increasingly innovative technical prowess, culminating in the cognitive ascendancy of Homo sapiens. The conjecture overlooks a plausible likelihood that behavior by an individual who was atypical among her conspecifics could have been disregarded in a community of Hominina (for definition see Appendix 1) that failed to recognize, imagine, or articulate potential advantages of adopting hitherto unorthodox behavior. Such failure, as well as diverse fortuitous demographic accidents, would cause exceptional personal behavior to be ignored and hence unremembered. It could disappear by a pitfall, down a 'snake', as it were, in the figurative evolutionary board game; thereby causing a discontinuity in the evolution of human behavior that presents like an evolutionary puzzle. The puzzle discomforts some paleoanthropologists trained in the natural and life sciences. They often dismiss it, explaining it away with such self-justifying conjectures as that, maybe, separate paleospecies of Homo differentially possessed different cognitive abilities, which, supposedly, could account for the presence or absence in the Pleistocene archeological record of traces of this or that behavioral outcome or skill. We argue that an alternative perspective - that inherits from the FEP and an individual's 'active inference' about its surroundings and of its own responses - affords a prosaic, deflationary, and parsimonious way to account for appearances, disappearances, and reappearances of particular behavioral outcomes and skills of early humankind.",

In this paper I present a scientific and philosophical synthesis of these studies, leading to an integrated view of cognitive biology. This view is expressed through the four principles applicable to all living systems: (1) sentience and consciousness, (2) autopoiesis, (3) free energy principle and relational biology, and (4) cognitive repertoire. The principles are circular, and they reinforce themselves. The circularity is not rigid, meaning that hierarchical and heterarchical shifts are widespread in the biosphere. The above principles emerged at the dawn of life, with the first cells, bacteria and archaea. All biogenic forms and functions that emerged since then can be traced to the first cells - indivisible units of biological agency. Following these principles, I developed the concept of biocivilisations to explain various forms of social intelligence in different kingdoms of life. The term biociviloisations draws on the human interpretation of the concept of civilisation, which searches for non-human equivalents of communication, engineering, science, medicine, art, and agriculture, in all kingdoms of life by applying the principles of cognitive biology. Potential avenues for testing the concept of biocivilisations are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a normative computational framework for iterative reduction of prediction error and uncertainty through perception-intervention cycles that has been presented as a potential unifying theory of all brain functions (Friston, 2006). Any theory hoping to unify the brain sciences must be able to explain the mechanisms of decision-making, an important cognitive faculty, without the addition of independent, irreducible notions. This challenge has been accepted by several proponents of the FEP (Friston, 2010; Gershman, 2019). We evaluate attempts to reduce decision-making to the FEP, using Lucas' (2005) meta-theory of the brain's contextual constraints as a guidepost. We find reductive variants of the FEP for decision-making unable to explain behavior in certain types of diagnostic, predictive, and multi-armed bandit tasks. We trace the shortcomings to the core theory's lack of an adequate notion of subjective preference or \"utility\", a concept central to decision-making and grounded in the brain's biological reality. We argue that any attempts to fully reduce utility to the FEP would require unrealistic assumptions, making the principle an unlikely candidate for unifying brain science. We suggest that researchers instead attempt to identify contexts in which either informational or independent reward constraints predominate, delimiting the FEP's area of applicability. To encourage this type of research, we propose a two-factor formal framework that can subsume any FEP model and allows experimenters to compare the contributions of informational versus reward constraints to behavior.",

Although defining proper social behavior is difficult because it differs from situation to situation, the agent following the proposed method adaptively behaves appropriately in each situation by empathizing with the surrounding others. The proposed method is achieved by incorporating empathy into active inference. We evaluated the proposed method regarding control of autonomous mobile robots in diverse situations. From the evaluation results, an agent controlled by the proposed method could behave more adaptively socially than an agent controlled by the standard active inference in the diverse situations. In the case of two agents, the agent controlled with the proposed method behaved in a social way that reduced the other agent's travel distance by 13.7% and increased the margin between the agents by 25.8%, even though it increased the agent's travel distance by 8.2%. Also, the agent controlled with the proposed method behaved more socially when it was surrounded by altruistic others but less socially when it was surrounded by selfish others.",

      "abstract": "The neural systems' electric activities are fundamental for the phenomenology of consciousness. Sensory perception triggers an information/energy exchange with the environment, but the brain's recurrent activations maintain a resting state with constant parameters. Therefore, perception forms a closed thermodynamic cycle. In physics, the Carnot engine is an ideal thermodynamic cycle that converts heat from a hot reservoir into work, or inversely, requires work to transfer heat from a low- to a high-temperature reservoir (the reversed Carnot cycle). We analyze the high entropy brain by the endothermic reversed Carnot cycle. Its irreversible activations provide temporal directionality for future orientation. A flexible transfer between neural states inspires openness and creativity. In contrast, the low entropy resting state parallels reversible activations, which impose past focus via repetitive thinking, remorse, and regret. The exothermic Carnot cycle degrades mental energy. Therefore, the brain's energy/information balance formulates motivation, sensed as position or negative emotions. Our work provides an analytical perspective of positive and negative emotions and spontaneous behavior from the free energy principle. Furthermore, electrical activities, thoughts, and beliefs lend themselves to a temporal organization, an orthogonal condition to physical systems. Here, we suggest that an experimental validation of the thermodynamic origin of emotions might inspire better treatment options for mental diseases.",

      "abstract": "Coherence Therapy is an empirically derived experiential psychotherapy based on Psychological Constructivism. Symptoms are viewed as necessary output from an implicit model of the world. The therapist curates experiences and directs attention toward discovering the model. Rendered explicit, the model is juxtaposed with contradictory knowledge driving memory re-consolidation with resolution of the symptom. The Bayesian Brain views perception and action as inferential processes. Prior beliefs are combined in a generative model to explain the hidden causes of sensations through a process of Active Inference. Prior beliefs that are poor fits to the real world are suboptimal. Suboptimal priors with optimal inference produce Bayes Optimal Pathology with behavioral symptoms. The Active Inference Model of Coherence Therapy posits that Coherence Therapy is a dyadic act of therapist guided Active Inference that renders the (probable) hidden causes of a client's behavior conscious. The therapist's sustained attention on the goal of inference helps to overcome memory control bias against retrieval of the affectively charged suboptimal prior. Serial experiences cue memory retrieval and re-instantiation of the physiological/affective state that necessitates production of the symptom in a particular context. As this process continues there is a break in modularity with assimilation into broader networks of experience. Typically, the symptom produced by optimal inference with the suboptimal prior is experienced as unnecessary/inappropriate when taken out of the particular context. The implicit construct has been re-represented and rendered consciously accessible, by a more complex but more accurate model in which the symptom is necessary in some contexts but not others. There is an experience of agency and control in symptom creation, accompanied by the spontaneous production of context appropriate behavior. The capacity for inference has been restored. The Active Inference Model of Coherence Therapy provides a framework for Coherence Therapy as a computational process which can serve as the basis for new therapeutic interventions and experimental designs integrating biological, cognitive, behavioral, and environmental factors.",

I then go on to describe predictive processing models of brains and their connections to machine learning architectures, with particular emphasis on autoencoders (perceptual and active inference), turbo-codes (establishment of shared latent spaces for multi-modal integration and inferential synergy), and graph neural networks (spatial and somatic modeling and control). Future directions for IIT and GNWT are considered by exploring ways in which modules and workspaces may be evaluated as both complexes of integrated information and arenas for iterated Bayesian model selection. Based on these considerations, I suggest novel ways in which integrated information might be estimated using concepts from probabilistic graphical models, flow networks, and game theory. Mechanistic and computational principles are also considered with respect to the ongoing debate between IIT and GNWT regarding the physical substrates of different kinds of conscious and unconscious phenomena. I further explore how these ideas might relate to the \"Bayesian blur problem,\" or how it is that a seemingly discrete experience can be generated from probabilistic modeling, with some consideration of analogies from quantum mechanics as potentially revealing different varieties of inferential dynamics. I go on to describe potential means of addressing critiques of causal structure theories based on network unfolding, and the seeming absurdity of conscious expander graphs (without cybernetic symbol grounding). Finally, I discuss future directions for work centered on attentional selection and the evolutionary origins of consciousness as facilitated \"unlimited associative learning.\" While not quite solving the Hard problem, this article expands on IWMT as a unifying model of consciousness and the potential future evolution of minds.",

      "abstract": "Based on a material view and reductionism, science has achieved great success. These cognitive paradigms treat the external as an objective existence and ignore internal consciousness. However, this cognitive paradigm, which we take for granted, has also led to some dilemmas related to consciousness in biology and physics. Together, these phenomena reveal the interaction and inseparable side of matter and consciousness (or body and mind) rather than the absolute opposition. However, a material view that describes matter and consciousness in opposition cannot explain the underlying principle, which causes a gap in interpretation. For example, consciousness is believed to be the key to influencing wave function collapse (reality), but there is a lack of a scientific model to study how this happens. In this study, we reveal that the theory of scientific cognition exhibits a paradigm shift in terms of perception. This tendency implies that reconciling the relationship between matter and consciousness requires an abstract theoretical model that is not based on physical forms. We propose that the holistic cognitive paradigm offers a potential solution to reconcile the dilemmas and can be scientifically proven. In contrast to the material view, the holistic cognitive paradigm is based on the objective contradictory nature of perception rather than the external physical characteristics. This cognitive paradigm relies on perception and experience (not observation) and summarizes all existence into two abstract contradictory perceptual states (Yin-Yang). Matter and consciousness can be seen as two different states of perception, unified in perception rather than in opposition. This abstract perspective offers a distinction from the material view, which is also the key to falsification, and the occurrence of an event is inseparable from the irrational state of the observer's conscious perception. Alternatively, from the material view, the event is random and has nothing to do with perception. We hope that this study can provide some new enlightenment for the scientific coordination of the opposing relationship between matter and consciousness.",

      "abstract": "Cognition, historically considered uniquely human capacity, has been recently found to be the ability of all living organisms, from single cells and up. This study approaches cognition from an info-computational stance, in which structures in nature are seen as information, and processes (information dynamics) are seen as computation, from the perspective of a cognizing agent. Cognition is understood as a network of concurrent morphological/morphogenetic computations unfolding as a result of self-assembly, self-organization, and autopoiesis of physical, chemical, and biological agents. The present-day human-centric view of cognition still prevailing in major encyclopedias has a variety of open problems. This article considers recent research about morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, basal cognition, extended evolutionary synthesis, free energy principle, cognition as Bayesian learning, active inference, and related topics, offering new theoretical and practical perspectives on problems inherent to the old computationalist cognitive models which were based on abstract symbol processing, and unaware of actual physical constraints and affordances of the embodiment of cognizing agents. A better understanding of cognition is centrally important for future artificial intelligence, robotics, medicine, and related fields.",

      "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) represents a fundamental problem for autonomous embodied systems, for which the hippocampal/entorhinal system (H/E-S) has been optimized over the course of evolution. We have developed a biologically-inspired SLAM architecture based on latent variable generative modeling within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference (FEP-AI) framework, which affords flexible navigation and planning in mobile robots. We have primarily focused on attempting to reverse engineer H/E-S \"design\" properties, but here we consider ways in which SLAM principles from robotics may help us better understand nervous systems and emergent minds. After reviewing LatentSLAM and notable features of this control architecture, we consider how the H/E-S may realize these functional properties not only for physical navigation, but also with respect to high-level cognition understood as generalized simultaneous localization and mapping (G-SLAM). We focus on loop-closure, graph-relaxation, and node duplication as particularly impactful architectural features, suggesting these computational phenomena may contribute to understanding cognitive insight (as proto-causal-inference), accommodation (as integration into existing schemas), and assimilation (as category formation). All these operations can similarly be describable in terms of structure/category learning on multiple levels of abstraction. However, here we adopt an ecological rationality perspective, framing H/E-S functions as orchestrating SLAM processes within both concrete and abstract hypothesis spaces. In this navigation/search process, adaptive cognitive equilibration between assimilation and accommodation involves balancing tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation; this dynamic equilibrium may be near optimally realized in FEP-AI, wherein control systems governed by expected free energy objective functions naturally balance model simplicity and accuracy. With respect to structure learning, such a balance would involve constructing models and categories that are neither too inclusive nor exclusive. We propose these (generalized) SLAM phenomena may represent some of the most impactful sources of variation in cognition both within and between individuals, suggesting that modulators of H/E-S functioning may potentially illuminate their adaptive significances as fundamental cybernetic control parameters. Finally, we discuss how understanding H/E-S contributions to G-SLAM may provide a unifying framework for high-level cognition and its potential realization in artificial intelligences.",

Is this phenomenon, known as sensory attenuation, enabled innately, or acquired through learning? Here, our simulation study using a multimodal hierarchical recurrent neural network model, based on variational free-energy minimization, shows that a mechanism for sensory attenuation can develop through learning of two distinct types of sensorimotor experience, involving self-produced or externally produced exteroceptions. For each sensorimotor context, a particular free-energy state emerged through interaction between top-down prediction with precision and bottom-up sensory prediction error from each sensory area. The executive area in the network served as an information hub. Consequently, shifts between the two sensorimotor contexts triggered transitions from one free-energy state to another in the network via executive control, which caused shifts between attenuating and amplifying prediction-error-induced responses in the sensory areas. This study situates emergence of sensory attenuation (or self-other distinction) in development of distinct free-energy states in the dynamic hierarchical neural system.",

      "abstract": "Intersubjectivity refers to one person's awareness in relation to another person's awareness. It is key to well-being and human development. From infancy to adulthood, human interactions ceaselessly contribute to the flourishing or impairment of intersubjectivity. In this work, we first describe intersubjectivity as a hallmark of quality dyadic processes. Then, using parent-child relationship as an example, we propose a dyadic active inference model to elucidate an inverse relation between stress and intersubjectivity. We postulate that impaired intersubjectivity is a manifestation of underlying problems of deficient relational benevolence, misattributing another person's intentions (over-mentalizing), and neglecting the effects of one's own actions on the other person (under-coupling). These problems can exacerbate stress due to excessive variational free energy in a person's active inference engine when that person feels threatened and holds on to his/her invalid (mis)beliefs. In support of this dyadic model, we briefly describe relevant neuroimaging literature to elucidate brain networks underlying the effects of an intersubjectivity-oriented parenting intervention on parenting stress. Using the active inference dyadic model, we identified critical interventional strategies necessary to rectify these problems and hereby developed a coding system in reference to these strategies. In a theory-guided quantitative review, we used this coding system to code 35 clinical trials of parenting interventions published between 2016 and 2020, based on PubMed database, to predict their efficacy for reducing parenting stress. The results of this theory-guided analysis corroborated our hypothesis that parenting intervention can effectively reduce parenting stress if the intervention is designed to mitigate the problems of deficient relational benevolence, under-coupling, and over-mentalizing. We integrated our work with several dyadic concepts identified in the literature. Finally, inspired by Arya Nagarjuna's Buddhist Madhyamaka Philosophy, we described abstract expressions of Dependent Origination as a relational worldview to reflect on the normality, impairment, and rehabilitation of intersubjectivity.",

In other words, they do not consider where to sample next, given current beliefs. Here, we reclaim salience as an active inference process that relies on two basic principles: uncertainty minimization and rhythmic scheduling. For this, we make a distinction between attention and salience. Briefly, we associate attention with precision control, i.e., the confidence with which beliefs can be updated given sampled sensory data, and salience with uncertainty minimization that underwrites the selection of future sensory data. Using this, we propose a new account of attention based on rhythmic precision-modulation and discuss its potential in robotics, providing numerical experiments that showcase its advantages for state and noise estimation, system identification and action selection for informative path planning.",

      "abstract": "Affective empathy is an indispensable ability for humans and other species' harmonious social lives, motivating altruistic behavior, such as consolation and aid-giving. How to build an affective empathy computational model has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Most affective empathy models focus on the recognition and simulation of facial expressions or emotional speech of humans, namely Affective Computing. However, these studies lack the guidance of neural mechanisms of affective empathy. From a neuroscience perspective, affective empathy is formed gradually during the individual development process: experiencing own emotion-forming the corresponding Mirror Neuron System (MNS)-understanding the emotions of others through the mirror mechanism. Inspired by this neural mechanism, we constructed a brain-inspired affective empathy computational model, this model contains two submodels: (1) We designed an Artificial Pain Model inspired by the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to the simulate pain generation process in living organisms. (2) We build an affective empathy spiking neural network (AE-SNN) that simulates the mirror mechanism of MNS and has self-other differentiation ability. We apply the brain-inspired affective empathy computational model to the pain empathy and altruistic rescue task to achieve the rescue of companions by intelligent agents. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one to reproduce the emergence process of mirror neurons and anti-mirror neurons in the SNN field. Compared with traditional affective empathy computational models, our model is more biologically plausible, and it provides a new perspective for achieving artificial affective empathy, which has special potential for the social robots field in the future.",

      "abstract": "According to the free energy principle, all sentient beings strive to minimize surprise or, in other words, an information-theoretical quantity called variational free energy. Consequently, psychosocial \"stress\" can be redefined as a state of \"heightened expected free energy,\" that is, a state of \"expected surprise\" or \"uncertainty.\" Individuals experiencing stress primarily attempt to reduce uncertainty, or expected free energy, with the help of what is called an uncertainty resolution program (URP). The URP consists of three subroutines: First, an arousal state is induced that increases cerebral information transmission and processing to reduce uncertainty as quickly as possible. Second, these additional computations cost the brain additional energy, which it demands from the body. Third, the program controls which stress reduction measures are learned for future use and which are not. We refer to an episode as \"good\" stress, when the URP has successfully reduced uncertainty. Failure of the URP to adequately reduce uncertainty results in either stress habituation or prolonged toxic stress. Stress habituation reduces uncertainty by flattening/broadening individual goal beliefs so that outcomes previously considered as untenable become acceptable. Habituated individuals experience so-called \"tolerable\" stress. Referring to the Selfish Brain theory and the experimental evidence supporting it, we show that habituated people, who lack stress arousals and therefore have decreased average brain energy consumption, tend to develop an obese type 2 diabetes mellitus phenotype. People, for whom habituation is not the free-energy-optimal solution, do not reduce their uncertainty by changing their goal preferences, and are left with nothing but \"toxic\" stress. Toxic stress leads to recurrent or persistent arousal states and thus increased average brain energy consumption, which in turn promotes the development of a lean type 2 diabetes mellitus phenotype. In conclusion, we anchor the psychosomatic concept of stress in the information-theoretical concept of uncertainty as defined by the free energy principle. In addition, we detail the neurobiological mechanisms underlying uncertainty reduction and illustrate how uncertainty can lead to psychosomatic illness.",

      "abstract": "Osteopaths commonly face complexity and clinical uncertainty in their daily professional practice as primary contact practitioners. In order to effectively deal with complex clinical presentations, osteopaths need to possess well-developed clinical reasoning to understand the individual patient's lived experience of pain and other symptoms and how their problem impacts their personhood and ability to engage with their world. We have recently proposed (En)active inference as an integrative framework for osteopathic care. The enactivist and active inference frameworks underpin our integrative hypothesis. Here, we present a clinically based interpretation of our integrative hypothesis by considering the ecological niche in which osteopathic care occurs. Active inference enables patients and practitioners to disambiguate each other's mental states. The patients' mental states are unobservable and must be inferred based on perceptual cues such as posture, body language, gaze direction and response to touch and hands-on care. A robust therapeutic alliance centred on cooperative communication and shared narratives and the appropriate and effective use of touch and hands-on care enable patients to contextualize their lived experiences. Touch and hands-on care enhance the therapeutic alliance, mental state alignment, and biobehavioural synchrony between patient and practitioner. Therefore, the osteopath-patient dyad provides mental state alignment and opportunities for ecological niche construction. Arguably, this can produce therapeutic experiences which reduce the prominence given to high-level prediction errors-and consequently, the top-down attentional focus on bottom-up sensory prediction errors, thus minimizing free energy. This commentary paper primarily aims to enable osteopaths to critically consider the value of this proposed framework in appreciating the complexities of delivering person-centred care.",

Several hypotheses have been proposed in psychology and social science to understand the genesis of these beliefs during a pandemic, including generational, socio-cultural and political characteristics of individuals, and psychological factors such as the desire to preserve one's safety, to maintain a positive self-image, or even to strengthen its social role. However, recent discoveries in cognitive science about belief updating mechanisms offer new insights into the generation of conspiratorial beliefs across time and culture. In this paper, we offer a definition of conspiracy theory and a classification of conspiracy beliefs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show how the mechanisms of belief updating may explain the genesis of conspiracy theories, and we propose several hypotheses supported by contemporary research in cognitive and social science.",

      "abstract": "We apply the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). FEP describes the basic functioning of the brain as a predictive organ and states that any self-organizing system that is in equilibrium with its environment must minimize its free energy. Based on an internal model of the world and the self, predictions-so-called priors-are created, which are matched with the information input. The sum of prediction errors corresponds to the Free Energy, which must be minimized. Internal models can be identified with the cognitive-affective schemas of the individual that has become dysfunctional in patients. The role of CBT in this picture is to help the patient update her/his priors. They have evolved in learning history and no longer provide adaptive predictions. We discuss the process of updating in terms of the exploration-exploitation dilemma. This consists of the extent to which one relies on what one already has, i.e., whether one continues to maintain and \"exploit\" one's previous priors (\"better safe than sorry\") or whether one does explore new data that lead to an update of priors. Questioning previous priors triggers stress, which is associated with increases in Free Energy in short term. The role of therapeutic relationship is to buffer this increase in Free Energy, thereby increasing the level of perceived safety. The therapeutic relationship is represented in a dual model of affective alliance and goal attainment alliance and is aligned with FEP. Both forms of alliance support exploration and updating of priors. All aspects are illustrated with the help of a clinical case example.",

However, confusion exists with respect to how this dynamical systems account of multi-agent learning should be interpreted.

The purpose of this work is to make the connections between these levels explicit in order to gain improved insight into multi-agent learning. I demonstrate the usefulness of this framework with the general and widespread class of temporal-difference reinforcement learning. I find that its deterministic dynamical systems description follows a minimum free-energy principle and unifies a boundedly rational account of game theory with decision-making under uncertainty. I then propose an on-line sample-batch temporal-difference algorithm which is characterized by the combination of applying a memory-batch and separated state-action value estimation. I find that this algorithm serves as a micro-foundation of the deterministic learning equations by showing that its learning trajectories approach the ones of the deterministic learning equations under large batch sizes. Ultimately, this framework of embedding a dynamical systems description into different abstraction levels gives guidance on how to unleash the full potential of the dynamical systems approach to multi-agent learning.",

They form flexible spatial representations of their surroundings that can be leveraged with ease during spatial foraging and navigation. To capture these abilities, we present a deep Active Inference model of goal-directed behavior, and the accompanying belief updating. Active Inference rests upon optimizing Bayesian beliefs to maximize model evidence or marginal likelihood. Bayesian beliefs are probability distributions over the causes of observable outcomes. These causes include an agent's actions, which enables one to treat planning as inference. We use simulations of a geocaching task to elucidate the belief updating-that underwrites spatial foraging-and the associated behavioral and neurophysiological responses. In a geocaching task, the aim is to find hidden objects in the environment using spatial coordinates. Here, synthetic agents learn about the environment via inference and learning (e.g., learning about the likelihoods of outcomes given latent states) to reach a target location, and then forage locally to discover the hidden object that offers clues for the next location.",

By contrast, joint agent-environment systems theory is focused on reciprocal synchronous generative development.

First, a practitioner description of the theory is provided. Then, the theory is extended through reference to research concerned with multilevel pragmatics, competing signals, commitment processes, technological mediation, and psychomotor functioning. In addition, the theory is related to human-driven biosocial-technical innovation through the example of digital twins for agroecological urban farming. Digital twins being digital models that mirror physical processes; that are connected to physical processes through, for example, sensors and actuators; and which carry out analyses of physical processes in order to improve their performance. Together, these contributions extend extant theory towards application for synchronous generative development that balances human well-being and environmental well-being. However, the practical examples in the paper indicate that counterproductive complexity can arise from situated entropy amidst biosocial-technical innovations: even when those innovations are compatible with synchronous generative development.",

It focuses on Bayesian model selection and the assimilation of training data or content, with a special emphasis on the order in which data are ingested. A key move-in the ensuing schemes-is to place priors on the selection of models, based upon expected free energy. In this setting, expected free energy reduces to a constrained mutual information, where the constraints inherit from priors over outcomes (i.e., preferred outcomes). The resulting scheme is first used to perform image classification on the MNIST dataset to illustrate the basic idea, and then tested on a more challenging problem of discovering models with dynamics, using a simple sprite-based visual disentanglement paradigm and the Tower of Hanoi (cf., blocks world) problem. In these examples, generative models are constructed autodidactically to recover (i.e., disentangle) the factorial structure of latent states-and their characteristic paths or dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework for modeling the brain that explains a wide range of mechanisms. Recently, two versions of branching time active inference (BTAI) have been developed to handle the exponential (space and time) complexity class that occurs when computing the prior over all possible policies up to the time horizon. However, those two versions of BTAI still suffer from an exponential complexity class with regard to the number of observed and latent variables being modeled. We resolve this limitation by allowing each observation to have its own likelihood mapping and each latent variable to have its own transition mapping. The implicit mean field approximation was tested in terms of its efficiency and computational cost using a dSprites environment in which the metadata of the dSprites data set was used as input to the model. In this setting, earlier implementations of branching time active inference (namely, BTAIVMP and BTAIBF) underperformed in relation to the mean field approximation (BTAI3MF) in terms of performance and computational efficiency. Specifically, BTAIVMP was able to solve 96.9% of the task in 5.1 seconds, and BTAIBF was able to solve 98.6% of the task in 17.5 seconds. Our new approach outperformed both of its predecessors by solving the task completely (100%) in only 2.559 seconds.",

There is also an emerging consensus that children are Bayesian learners who combine their structured prior beliefs with estimations of the likelihood of new evidence to infer the most probable model of the world. An influential school of thought within developmental psychology, rational constructivism, combines these two ideas to propose that children learn intuitive theories of how the world works in part by engaging in play activities that allow them to gather new information for testing their theories. There are still, however, at least two pieces missing from rational constructivist theories of development. First, rational constructivism has so far devoted little attention to explaining why children's preferred form of learning, play, feels so fun, enjoyable, and rewarding. Rational constructivism may suggest that children are curious and like to play because reducing uncertainty and learning better theories of the causal workings of the world is enjoyable. What remains unclear, however, is why reducing uncertainty in play is interesting, fun, and joyful, while doing so in other forms of learning can be frustrating or boring. Second, rational constructivism may have overlooked how children, during play, will take control of and manipulate their environment, sometimes in an effort to create ideal niches for surprise-extraction, sometimes for developing strategies for making the world fit with their predictions. These missing elements from rational constructivism can be provided by understanding the contribution of play to development in terms of predictive processing, an influential framework in cognitive neuroscience that models many of the brain's cognitive functions as processes of model-based, probabilistic prediction.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a theory of perception, learning, and decision making that can be applied to neuroscience, robotics, psychology, and machine learning. Recently, intensive research has been taking place to scale up this framework using Monte Carlo tree search and deep learning. The goal of this activity is to solve more complicated tasks using deep active inference. First, we review the existing literature and then progressively build a deep active inference agent as follows: we (1) implement a variational autoencoder (VAE), (2) implement a deep hidden Markov model (HMM), and (3) implement a deep critical hidden Markov model (CHMM). For the CHMM, we implemented two versions, one minimizing expected free energy, CHMM[EFE] and one maximizing rewards, CHMM[reward]. Then we experimented with three different action selection strategies: the ε-greedy algorithm as well as softmax and best action selection. According to our experiments, the models able to solve the dSprites environment are the ones that maximize rewards. On further inspection, we found that the CHMM minimizing expected free energy almost always picks the same action, which makes it unable to solve the dSprites environment. In contrast, the CHMM maximizing reward keeps on selecting all the actions, enabling it to successfully solve the task. The only difference between those two CHMMs is the epistemic value, which aims to make the outputs of the transition and encoder networks as close as possible. Thus, the CHMM minimizing expected free energy repeatedly picks a single action and becomes an expert at predicting the future when selecting this action. This effectively makes the KL divergence between the output of the transition and encoder networks small. Additionally, when selecting the action down the average reward is zero, while for all the other actions, the expected reward will be negative. Therefore, if the CHMM has to stick to a single action to keep the KL divergence small, then the action down is the most rewarding. We also show in simulation that the epistemic value used in deep active inference can behave degenerately and in certain circumstances effectively lose, rather than gain, information. As the agent minimizing EFE is not able to explore its environment, the appropriate formulation of the epistemic value in deep active inference remains an open question.",

Our model leverages advances in computational psychiatry and neuroscience, offering a mechanistic explanation for these symptoms by illustrating how prolonged trauma disrupts the brain's predictive processing. Specifically, altered predictive mechanisms contribute to C-PTSD's symptomatology, focusing on DSO: (1) Negative self-concept emerges from maladaptive priors that bias perception towards self-criticism, misaligning expected and actual interoceptive states; (2) Misalignment between predicted and actual interoceptive signals leads to affect dysregulation, with sensitivity to bodily cues; and (3) Relationship challenges arise from skewed social prediction errors, fostering mistrust and withdrawal. This precision-focused approach sheds light on the dynamics underpinning C-PTSD and highlights potential intervention targets aimed at recalibrating the predictive processing system.",

We focus on signals sufficient for proprioceptive awareness, particularly from muscle spindle activation and from primary motor cortex (M1). Our review of muscle vibration studies reveals that afferent signals alone can induce conscious sensations of movement. Similarly, studies employing peripheral nerve blocks suggest that efferent signals from M1 are sufficient for sensations of movement. On this basis, we show that competing theories of motor control assign different roles to sensation of movement. According to motor command theories, sensation of movement corresponds to an estimation of the current state based on afferent signals, efferent signals, and predictions. In contrast, within active inference architectures, sensations correspond to proprioceptive predictions driven by efferent signals from M1. The focus on sensation of movement provides a way to critically compare and evaluate the two theories. Our analysis offers new insights into the functional roles of movement sensations in motor control and consciousness.",

      "abstract": "Need states are internal states that arise from deprivation of crucial biological stimuli. They direct motivation, independently of external learning. Despite their separate origin, they interact with reward processing systems that respond to external stimuli. This article aims to illuminate the functioning of the needing system through the lens of active inference, a framework for understanding brain and cognition. We propose that need states exert a pervasive influence on the organism, which in active inference terms translates to a \"pervasive surprise\"-a measure of the distance from the organism's preferred state. Crucially, we define needing as an active inference process that seeks to reduce this pervasive surprise. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate that our proposal successfully captures key aspects of the phenomenology and neurobiology of needing. We show that as need states increase, the tendency to occupy preferred states strengthens, independently of external reward prediction. Furthermore, need states increase the precision of states (stimuli and actions) leading to preferred states, suggesting their ability to amplify the value of reward cues and rewards themselves. Collectively, our model and simulations provide valuable insights into the directional and underlying influence of need states, revealing how this influence amplifies the wanting or liking associated with relevant stimuli.",

      "abstract": "The fear-avoidance model is a well-established framework in the understanding of persistent pain. It proposes a dichotomous path: either the context is interpreted as safe; there is no fear reaction and, therefore, the individual engages in active (positive) coping; or the context is interpreted as threatening, leading to a self-reinforcing vicious circle of fear and (negative) avoidance. We propose an embodied interpretation of this phenomenon employing the joint framework of predictive coding and active inference. The key idea is that multisensory integration of exteroceptive, proprioceptive, and interoceptive sensory inputs can lead to dysfunctional experiences of threat in nonthreatening situations. Threat inference can promote fear responses, maladaptive strategies (i.e., avoidance) and self-provides evidence for threat in associated or future contexts, or both. Under this treatment, the prediction of nonrealized threat becomes self-evidencing and context-invariant, and hence self-perpetuating. Safety cues are unable to attenuate the interpretation of the negative context as the dominant inference of the context is threatful and gains more precision and becomes resistant over time. Our model provides an explanation for the emergence of a dysfunctional fear response in the clinical setting despite apparent safety based on modern concepts from theoretical (computational) neuroscience.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers neural representation through the lens of active inference, a normative framework for understanding brain function. It delves into how living organisms employ generative models to minimize the discrepancy between predictions and observations (as scored with variational free energy). The ensuing analysis suggests that the brain learns generative models to navigate the world adaptively, not (or not solely) to understand it. Different living organisms may possess an array of generative models, spanning from those that support action-perception cycles to those that underwrite planning and imagination; namely, from explicit models that entail variables for predicting concurrent sensations, like objects, faces, or people-to action-oriented models that predict action outcomes. It then elucidates how generative models and belief dynamics might link to neural representation and the implications of different types of generative models for understanding an agent's cognitive capabilities in relation to its ecological niche. The paper concludes with open questions regarding the evolution of generative models and the development of advanced cognitive abilities-and the gradual transition from pragmatic to detached neural representations. The analysis on offer foregrounds the diverse roles that generative models play in cognitive processes and the evolution of neural representation.",

For evaluating the behavior of an active vision agent, we also propose a new benchmark where, given a target viewpoint of a particular object, the agent needs to find the best matching viewpoint given a workspace with randomly positioned objects in 3D. We demonstrate that our active inference agent is able to balance epistemic foraging and goal-driven behavior, and quantitatively outperforms both supervised and reinforcement learning baselines by more than a factor of two in terms of success rate.",

We explain migraine within the frameworks of allostasis (the situationally-flexible, forward-looking equivalent of homeostasis) and active inference (interacting with the environment via internally-generated predictions). Due to its multimodality, and long timescales between cause and effect, allostasis is inherently prone to catastrophic error, which might be impossible to correct once fully manifest, an early indicator which is elevated prediction error (discrepancy between prediction and sensory input) associated with internal sensations (interoception). Errors can usually be resolved in a targeted manner by action (correcting the physiological state) or perception (updating predictions in light of sensory input); persistent errors are amplified broadly and multimodally, to prioritise their resolution (the migraine premonitory phase); finally, if still unresolved, progressive amplification renders further changes to internal or external sensory inputs intolerably intense, enforcing physiological stability, and facilitating accurate allostatic prediction updating. As such, migraine is an effective 'failsafe' for allostasis, however it has potential to become excessively triggered, therefore maladaptive.",

To address this paradox, we propose to frame suicide in the integrated theory of stress and active inference. We present an active inference-based cognitive model of suicide as a type of stress response hanging in cognitive balance between predicting self-preservation and self-destruction. In it, self-efficacy emerges as a meta-cognitive regulator that can bias the model toward either survival or suicide. The model suggests conditions under which cognitive homeostasis can override physiological homeostasis in motivating self-destruction. We also present a model proto-suicidal behavior, programmed cell death (apoptosis), in active inference terms to illustrate how an active inference model of self-destruction can be embodied in molecular mechanisms and to offer a hypothesis on another puzzle of suicide: why only humans among brain-endowed animals are known to practice it.",

Despite the importance of interoception in cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry, its experimental manipulation remains technically challenging. This is due to the invasive nature of existing methods, the limitation of self-report and unimodal measures of interoception, and the absence of standardized approaches across disparate fields. This article integrates diverse research efforts from psychology, physiology, psychiatry, and engineering to address this oversight. Following a general introduction to the neurophysiology of interoception as hierarchical predictive processing, we review the existing paradigms for manipulating interoception (e.g., interoceptive modulation), their underlying mechanisms (e.g., interoceptive conditioning), and clinical applications (e.g., interoceptive exposure). We suggest a classification for interoceptive technologies and discuss their potential for diagnosing and treating mental health disorders. Despite promising results, considerable work is still needed to develop standardized, validated measures of interoceptive function across domains and before these technologies can translate safely and effectively to clinical settings.",

However, emerging evidence from the fields of predictive coding and active inference offers a novel lens through which to understand ADHD not merely as a disorder of attention but as a distinctive mode of neurodevelopmental variation. This article synthesizes current research and theoretical models to propose a redefined understanding of ADHD. By integrating insights from Ryan Smith, Paul B. Badcock, and Karl J. Friston (2020), we explore the premise that individuals with ADHD exhibit unique differences in how their brains generate and update predictions about the environment, leading to the characteristic behavioral patterns observed in ADHD. We argue that ADHD involves a divergence in the brain's predictive models and its ability to minimize prediction error, impacting sensory processing, attention allocation, and motor control. This perspective illuminates the adaptive aspects of ADHD, suggesting that what are often labeled as deficits could also reflect an adaptive fit to certain environmental contexts, underscoring the role of neurodiversity in human evolution. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of this reconceptualization for clinical practice, including diagnosis, treatment, and support for individuals with ADHD, emphasizing approaches that align with their unique neurocognitive profiles. This article calls for a shift in the narrative surrounding ADHD, advocating for a model that appreciates the complexity and adaptiveness of neurodevelopmental diversity",

The CANFIS model is an adaptive neuro-fuzzy system that combines neural networks and fuzzy logic for processing data with uncertainty and fuzziness. CANFIS uses fuzzy rules and output mechanisms to convert input data into output values. It consists of several layers, including an input layer, hidden layers and an output layer, where each layer contains neurons performing fuzzy activation and output of results. The relevance of the work lies in the fact that the software implementation of the CANFIS model, based on the STL of the C++ language, is of great importance in the field of machine learning, artificial intelligence and data analysis. The work’s results can be applied in various fields, including when making decisions based on fuzzy logic. Special feature of the studied and developed model is to create an adaptive model capable of modeling systems with uncertainty and blurriness. The developed model is able to process data and make decisions based on fuzzy rules. CANFIS finds applications in various fields, including forecasting, management, classification and data analysis. It can be concluded that the developed neural network with fuzzy logic can be effectively applied in various fields where time series forecasting, system management and decision-making based on fuzzy information are used.",

It consists of procedures to estimate the envelope area, U-values, and efficiency values of the heat supply system. To all model input variables an uncertainty is assigned. If information from a query is not available, the model input is set to a state representing the average building stock and the uncertainty of this quantity is adjusted to a value reflecting the variance in the stock.

      "abstract": "In the past few decades, probabilistic interpretations of brain functions have become widespread in cognitive science and neuroscience. In particular, the free energy principle and active inference are increasingly popular theories of cognitive functions that claim to offer a unified understanding of life and cognition within a general mathematical framework derived from information and control theory, and statistical mechanics. However, we argue that if the active inference proposal is to be taken as a general process theory for biological systems, it is necessary to understand how it relates to existing control theoretical approaches routinely used to study and explain biological systems. For example, recently, PID control has been shown to be implemented in simple molecular systems and is becoming a popular mechanistic explanation of behaviours such as chemotaxis in bacteria and amoebae, and robust adaptation in biochemical networks. In this work, we will show how PID controllers can fit a more general theory of life and cognition under the principle of (variational) free energy minimisation when using approximate linear generative models of the world. This more general interpretation provides also a new perspective on traditional problems of PID controllers such as parameter tuning as well as the need to balance performances and robustness conditions of a controller. Specifically, we then show how these problems can be understood in terms of the optimisation of the precisions (inverse variances) modulating different prediction errors in the free energy functional.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Recent developments in computational psychiatry have led to the hypothesis that mood represents an expectation (prior belief) on the likely interoceptive consequences of action (i.e. emotion). This stems from ideas about how the brain navigates its external world by minimising an upper bound on surprisal (free energy) of sensory information and echoes developments in other perceptual domains.<h4>Aims</h4>In this paper we aim to present a simple partial observable Markov decision process that models mood updating in response to stressful or non-stressful environmental fluctuations while seeking to minimise surprisal in relation to prior beliefs about the likely interoceptive signals experienced with specific actions (attenuating or amplifying stress and pleasure signals).<h4>Method</h4>We examine how, by altering these prior beliefs we can model mood updating in depression, mania and anxiety.<h4>Results</h4>We discuss how these models provide a computational account of mood and its related psychopathology and relate it to previous research in reward processing.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Models such as this can provide hypotheses for experimental work and also open up the potential modelling of predicted disease trajectories in individual patients.",

Here, we show how different types of information-gain emerge when casting behaviour as surprise minimisation. We present two distinct mechanisms for goal-directed exploration that express separable profiles of active sampling to reduce uncertainty. ‘Hidden state’ exploration motivates agents to sample unambiguous observations to accurately infer the (hidden) state of the world. Conversely, ‘model parameter’ exploration, compels agents to sample outcomes associated with high uncertainty, if they are informative for their representation of the task structure. We illustrate the emergence of these types of information-gain, termed active inference and active learning, and show how these forms of exploration induce distinct patterns of ‘Bayes-optimal’ behaviour. Our findings provide a computational framework to understand how distinct levels of uncertainty induce different modes of information-gain in decision-making.",

Here I discuss whether this scepticism is ameliorated by acknowledging the role of action in the most ambitious approach to prediction error minimization, namely under the free energy principle. I argue that the scepticism remains but that the role of action in the free energy principle constrains the demon’s work. This yields new insights about the free energy principle, epistemology, and the place of mind in nature.",

In this article, we describe a computational model of visual neglect based upon active inference. Our objective is to establish a computational and neurophysiological process theory that can be used to disambiguate among the various causes of this important syndrome; namely, a computational neuropsychology of visual neglect. We introduce a Bayes optimal model based upon Markov decision processes that reproduces the visual searches induced by the line cancellation task (used to characterize visual neglect at the bedside). We then consider 3 distinct ways in which the model could be lesioned to reproduce neuropsychological (visual search) deficits. Crucially, these 3 levels of pathology map nicely onto the neuroanatomy of saccadic eye movements and the systems implicated in visual neglect.",

In contrast, decision making is an inherently discrete process, involving the selection among alternative courses of action. In this article, we consider the interface between the discrete and continuous processes that translate our decisions into movement in a Newtonian world-and how movement informs our decisions. We do so by appealing to active inference, with a special focus on the oculomotor system. Within this exemplar system, we argue that the superior colliculus is well placed to act as a discrete-continuous interface. Interestingly, when the neuronal computations within the superior colliculus are formulated in terms of active inference, we find that many aspects of its neuroanatomy emerge from the computations it must perform in this role.",

This study aimed to present a hierarchical recurrent neural network-based agent model grounded in the free-energy principle to explore these processes within the framework of allostasis. The model integrates interoceptive, proprioceptive, and exteroceptive predictive processing, which minimizes the variational free energy throughout the past and future contexts. Simulations of resting state showed that inferred (mentally simulated) homeostatic context modulated attentional shifts between a “being” mode (focused on present interoceptive perception) and a “doing” mode (involving proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensorimotor loops). Further, we identified a meta-attentional parameter that controls these shifts by influencing cognitive attitudes towards internally generated beliefs across network modules spanning the past to the future. By manipulating this parameter, we replicated mindfulness states (“deep-being” mode) in which attention remained focused on the present interoceptive state despite minimal sensory prediction errors. This study offers insights into the computational dynamics of mindfulness and mind-wandering, laying the groundwork for the future exploration of consciousness and pure awareness, which is a state of consciousness devoid of content.</p>",

It has been described as e.g. non-conceptual, atemporal, non-egoic and aperspectival. This paper aims to develop a computational model of MPE using the mathematics of variational free energy minimization derived from the free energy principle (FEP). I employ a computational neurophenomenology approach, formalising key phenomenological features of MPE within the active inference framework. The model incorporates parametric depth, allowing for higher-order inferences about generative model parameters. I relate specific model parameterisations to reported MPE qualities such as meta-awareness, equanimity, effortlessness, and non-conceptuality. The proposed model suggests that MPE arises when an agent achieves very low free energy through self-directed awareness and modulation of their generative model, particularly by emphasising awareness of awareness itself. The model predicts elements of MPE phenomenology including a sense of effortlessness, timelessness, and the potential for a \"zero-person perspective&rdquo;. The implementation details for a simulation of the proposed model are outlined, as well as directions for empirical validation.",

      "abstract": "Does semantic communication require a semantic information theory parallel to Shannon's information theory, or can Shannon's work be generalized for semantic communication? This paper advocates for the latter and introduces the semantic information G theory (with \"G\" denoting generalization). The core approach involves replacing the distortion constraint with the semantic constraint, achieved by utilizing a set of truth functions as a semantic channel. These truth functions enable the expression of semantic distortion, semantic information measures, and semantic information loss. Notably, the maximum semantic information criterion is shown to be equivalent to the maximum likelihood criterion and parallels the Regularized Least Squares criterion. The G theory is compatible with machine learning methodologies, offering enhanced capabilities for handling latent variables, often addressed through Variational Bayes. This paper systematically presents the generalization of Shannon's information theory into the G theory and its wide-ranging applications. The applications involve semantic communication, machine learning, constraint control, Bayesian confirmation, portfolio theory, and information value. Furthermore, insights from statistical physics are discussed: Shannon information is equated to free energy, semantic information to the free energy of local equilibrium systems, and information efficiency to the efficiency of free energy in performing work. The paper also proposes refining Friston's minimum free energy principle into the maximum information efficiency principle. Lastly, it discusses the limitations of the G theory in representing the semantics of complex data.",

      "abstract": "<p>This study concerns an interdisciplinary theoretical analysis of the underlying ways the depressed individual is related to the world. Specific aspects of this relation, namely time, mood and perception of affordances will be characterized. By understanding these relations from both an existential phenomenological Heideggerian approach and through the modern neuroscientific paradigm of the Free Energy Principle, we formulate a complementary conceptualization of the depressed person’s relation to the world. Furthermore, we argue that this interdisciplinary approach bears a synergic coupling, despite obvious epistemic and disciplinary differences. In essence The Free Energy Principle conceptualizes any human world relation as a dynamic process in a self-organizing system that attempts to minimize entropy from the surroundings by predicting the states of the world. To Heidegger, the human world relation constitutes Dasein as a being-in-the-world, where the world gets its meaning from Dasein's care. Dasein does this by projecting possibilities of the future based on its facticity. We argue that this interdisciplinary compatible conceptualization constitutes an epistemically useful alternative based on dynamic assumptions, unlike the conceptualization offered by DSM-5, We argue that these underlying assumptions are important to challenge, as recent research in psychedelic treatment of “treatment resistant” depressed patients provides interesting findings challenging our current view of depression. Because experiences of connectedness are the strongest predictor for positive clinical outcomes in these trials, we argue that a dynamic characterization of depression is beneficial. We argue that this dynamic characterization is beneficial to pursue, as it offers an interdisciplinary approach to understand how the depressed individual fundamentally is connected to the world.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Understanding the emergence of symbol systems, especially language, requires the construction of a computational model that reproduces both the developmental learning process in everyday life and the evolutionary dynamics of symbol emergence throughout history. This study introduces the collective predictive coding (CPC) hypothesis, which emphasizes and models the interdependence between forming internal representations through physical interactions with the environment and sharing and utilizing meanings through social semiotic interactions within a symbol emergence system. The total system dynamics is theorized from the perspective of {\\it predictive coding}. The hypothesis draws inspiration from computational studies grounded in probabilistic generative models and language games, including the Metropolis--Hastings naming game. Thus, playing such games among agents in a distributed manner can be interpreted as a decentralized Bayesian inference of representations shared by a multi-agent system. Moreover, this study explores the potential link between the CPC hypothesis and the free-energy principle, positing that symbol emergence adheres to the society-wide free-energy principle. Furthermore, this paper provides a new explanation for why large language models appear to possess knowledge about the world based on experience, even though they have neither sensory organs nor bodies.This paper reviews past approaches to symbol emergence systems, offers a comprehensive survey of related prior studies, and presents a discussion on CPC-based generalizations.

Study participants engaged in a virtual reality interceptive task while we manipulated performance incentives to induce situational pressure. We then assessed changes in physiological arousal, self-reported anxiety levels, task performance, and eye movement patterns. Employing Bayesian computational models of perception, we analysed how quickly predictive eye movements were adjusted across multiple trials. The results revealed that heightened anxiety led to a slower rate of updating predictive eye movements, accompanied by an increase in visual exploration of the environment. These findings deepen our understanding of how emotional states, like anxiety, interact with active inference behaviours. Specifically, they highlight the limitation imposed on updating predictive sensorimotor behaviours during anxious conditions. We discuss the implications of these findings within the context of theoretical frameworks such as the free energy principle, which conceptualises anxiety as a state of internal entropy that organisms seek to alleviate.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>We advance a novel formulation of cognitive control within the active inference framework. The theory proposes that cognitive control amounts to optimising a precision parameter, which acts as a control signal and balances the contributions of deliberative and habitual components of action selection. To illustrate the theory, we simulate a driving scenario in which the driver follows a well-known route, but encounters unexpected challenges. Our simulations show that a standard active inference model can form adaptive habits; i.e., can pass from deliberative to habitual control when the context is stable, but generally fails to revert to deliberative control, when the context changes. To address this failure of context-sensitivity, we introduce a novel type of hierarchical active inference, in which a lower level is responsible for behavioural control and the higher (or meta-cognitive) level observes the belief updating of the lower level below and is responsible for cognitive control. Crucially, the meta-cognitive level can both form habits and suspend them, by controlling the (precision) parameter that prioritizes deliberative choices at the behavioural level. Furthermore, we show that several processes linked to cognitive control — such as surprise detection, cognitive conflict monitoring, control signal regulation and specification, the simulation of future outcomes and the assessment of the costs of control and mental effort — stem coherently from the free energy minimization scheme that underpins active inference. Finally, we discuss the putative neurobiology of cognitive control by simulating brain dynamics in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways of the dopamine system, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the locus coeruleus.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Computational phenomenology has emerged as a powerful framework for investigating advanced meditation states and stages, and meditative development and endpoints. Various models have been proposed to mechanistically explain the diverse experiences associated with these practices, including enhanced well-being, attentional shifts, and defabrication, as well as minimal phenomenal experiences and meditative endpoints. However, these models have developed in disparate directions, and an integrative understanding of the underlying mechanisms of advanced meditation remains elusive. This review examines how computational models attempt to account for the phenomenology of advanced meditation, with a particular focus on Active Inference as a modeling framework. We find that a key point of convergence across models is the role of precision weighting as a driver of experiential shifts. Furthermore, we observe a marked difference between early models, which emphasize top-down attentional modulation toward interoception or specific focus objects, and later models which center on layer-specific precision re-weighting within the meditator’s hierarchical generative model. These differences arise from variations in the models' aims, scope, and definitions of contemplative practice. Few models address reported increases in cognitive flexibility and learning from meditation, fundamental mechanisms behind informal practice and affective processes, as well as processes underlying compassion traditions, remain underexplored. Addressing these gaps is crucial for refining computational models of advanced meditation and informing our understanding of its cognitive, affective, and experiential effects.</p>",

      "abstract": "Pavlovian “approach or avoid” impulses are critical behavioral biases that, in excess, are linked to multiple psychiatric conditions. To investigate how such biases contribute to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, we analyzed data from two clinical populations completing an aversive Go/NoGo task. This task disentangles motor action (Go or NoGo) from outcome valence (escape from, or avoidance of, an aversive stimulus), enabling the isolation of Pavlovian biases from instrumental learning processes. We compared multiple computational models that had previously been proposed to explain Pavlovian tendencies, including reinforcement learning, active inference, and drift diffusion–based approaches. We employed a hierarchical Bayesian inference procedure that treats model identity as a random factor at the individual level, allowing an unbiased determination of which mechanisms most accurately captured participants’ behavior. Across both datasets, models featuring Pavlovian context biases plus a value-decay mechanism best accounted for performance. By contrast, policy-based Pavlovian models and more complex approaches, such as those integrating working memory or active inference, were supported by fewer study participants. These findings suggest that reflexive biases exert a persistent influence on decision-making, and that value decay plays a critical role in shaping behavior over time. Our results demonstrate the importance of systematically comparing and accounting for relevant cognitive processes to explain observed task behaviors. Understanding the factors contributing to task performance may help clarify how Pavlovian tendencies relate to psychopathology, including, in our case, elevated suicide risk. Finally, we illustrate how a complete hierarchical model selection framework can be applied to identify the most plausible mechanisms underlying Pavlovian biases, offering a robust approach for advancing our understanding of task behaviors and establishing clinical utility in future studies. <h4>Author summary</h4>  Automatic “approach or avoid” reactions shape behavior, particularly in stressful or negative situations. In this study, we explored how these reflex-like tendencies might contribute to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Two clinical groups completed a computerized task measuring responses to unpleasant sounds. Participants made either active responses (pressing a button to stop a sound) or passive responses (refraining from pressing to avoid starting a sound), allowing us to examine the interplay of automatic impulses and learning from past experiences. Our analysis showed that behavior was best explained by a model combining stable “approach or avoid” impulses with a forgetting process that reduced reliance on past experiences over time. More complex models involving strategies or memory-based control were less effective. These findings suggest that individuals with suicidal tendencies may rely on persistent reflex-like behaviors and over-index recent outcomes, compromising their ability to learn in uncertain environmental conditions. Understanding these cognitive processes provides insights into why some individuals feel trapped in harmful patterns of thought and behavior. Our work highlights how identifying shared traits in clinical populations using model-based methods can inform targeted mental health interventions and improve our understanding of cognitive functioning across disorders.",

This paper proposes a novel conceptual framework, the therapeutic reset, which unifies diverse interventions that transiently disrupt pathological equilibria, thereby leveraging the intrinsic plasticity of biological systems to facilitate recalibration toward healthier set points. Drawing insights from active inference, dynamical systems theory and nested somatic collective intelligences, we illustrate how treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy, psychedelics, inflammatory perturbations and anaesthetic interventions create brief periods of heightened plasticity. We argue that the reset itself and plasticity more generally do not necessarily incline in the direction of better health and that therapeutic efficacy may depend especially on the quality of contextual elements including preparation, support and post-intervention scaffolding that guides the system towards an adaptive equilibrium. Future research should prioritise mechanistic studies to identify biomarkers of plasticity and delineate intervention-responsive signalling pathways, alongside clinical studies refining precise dosage and anatomical targeting, and identifying therapeutically salient parameters of the scaffolding around high-plasticity states. By strategically harnessing systems’ inherent capacity for correction, this framework offers transformative potential for treating otherwise intractable disorders through proactive, precision-based recalibration of maladaptive homeostatic networks.</p>",

This paper explores the application of Hybrid Active Inference (HAI) within AI-to-AI interactions, integrating Efficient Probabilistic Inference (EPI) and Extended Active Inference (EAI) as complementary cognitive frameworks. By analyzing structured transcripts from Gemini-Copilot dialogues, this study identifies adaptive inference transitions, where AI systems shift between internal probabilistic reasoning and external environmental adaptation. The study builds upon the theoretical argument for dynamic transitions between EPI and EAI, as outlined by Sudbury (2024) drawing on the contrasts between Aitchison & Lengyel's (2016) focus on efficient probabilistic inference through neural dynamics and Constant et al.'s (2022) concept of extended active inference leveraging environmental structures.

Fundamentally, conscious experience corresponds to generating a best-guess representation of what the sensory inputs the wakeful brain receives are about. This process can be computationally approached with predictive processing (PP): the brain constantly generates inferential, predictive representations to ‘explain away’ its sensory inputs. Empirical evidence supports the use of PP by the brain, yet it is not deemed sufficient to explain consciousness. We review two theories of consciousness using PP as building block: active inference theory and neurorepresentationalism. When witnessing computer simulations of PP and other computational models, they remain strikingly unconvincing as instances that might emulate consciousness. Considered in the context of computational functionalism, we argue that computational models suffer, by definition, from the ‘Problem of Numbers’: it does lie within the purview of mathematics to study numerical operations, but not to reveal all qualitative properties characteristic of consciousness. We argue that low-level neural phenomena, e.g. spike trains, can be captured by mathematics, but we need different descriptors and tools to study their emergent correspondence to high-level, conscious phenomena. These considerations also lead us to outline Indicators of Consciousness as applicable to AIs and robots.</p>",

We investigated the severity and impact of cognitive and physical fatigue in Long COVID, exploring associations with autonomic symptoms, interoceptive sensibility, illness perceptions and distress, underpinned by a novel framework integrating active inference and the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation.MethodOnline cross-sectional survey between November 2024 and September 2025. Adults with self-reported COVID-19 and ≥12 weeks of fatigue symptoms were recruited via convenience sampling and completed validated questionnaires assessing fatigue, autonomic symptoms, interoceptive sensibility, illness perceptions and distress. Correlations and regression analyses examined associations between variables. Results183 participants completed the survey. Fatigue severity and impact were high, with physical fatigue rated more severe (Z = −2.96, p = .003) and impactful (Z = -8.714, p &lt; .001) than cognitive fatigue. Correlational analyses showed moderate-to-strong associations between fatigue and autonomic symptoms, interoception, illness perceptions and distress. In regression models, these variables explained 21–54% of variance in fatigue. Autonomic symptoms were positively associated with cognitive and physical fatigue. Depression was associated with cognitive fatigue. Illness perceptions were associated with physical, but not cognitive fatigue. Interoceptive sensibility showed both positive and negative associations with fatigue.ConclusionsLong COVID fatigue is severe and multifaceted. It involves a dynamic interplay between dysfunction in physiological systems, illness perceptions, and distress, with interactions varying across dimensions of fatigue. We propose a framework of interacting physiological and psychological factors that shape the prediction and processing of bodily signals, ultimately giving rise to fatigue.</p>",

Here, we propose an integrative theory ofthe noradrenergic system, suggesting that it encodes expected information gain (EIG), a measure of howinformative the environment is over time, and that it uses this quantity for the meta-control of adaptivebehavior. We illustrate this theory using a hierarchical active inference model in which the NA systemacts as a higher-level meta-controller that dynamically adjusts a set of parameters (η) of a lower-levelbehavioral controller, modulating exploration rate, the balance between deliberative and habitual control,perceptual precision, learning rate, and cognitive flexibility. Simulations demonstrate that NA-basedEIG estimation and meta-control enhance performance in volatile environments by promoting directedexploration, facilitating rapid shifts away from maladaptive habits, sharpening sensory evidence, andaccelerating learning following context changes. These results unify multiple facets of noradrenergicfunction under a single computational objective, providing a novel perspective to explain tonic andphasic NA activity in estimating EIG and meta-controlling behavior. Summing up, this frameworkprovides a principled link between neuromodulation, exploration, and adaptive behavior, suggestingthat the noradrenergic system implements a fundamental mechanism for inferring and exploiting theinformational richness of the environment.</p>",

By focusing on three things one is grateful for each day, gratitude practice may be a promising simple and scalable intervention to support well-being. However, there is mixed evidence of the efficacy of gratitude practice and we lack a mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes. Here we develop a computational model of gratitude practice to gain insight into the potential mechanisms of the practice. Employing the active inference framework, we present three simulation results. The first is an instantiation of gratitude practice as the deliberate deployment of high precision (i.e. attention) of three good observations throughout the day. We demonstrate theoretically how agents form their beliefs about their world from the environment they are in, and how these beliefs change positively after gratitude practice. To understand the impact on the agent’s worldview and to connect the modelling results to the empirical literature, we simulate an optimism assessment task before and after the intervention, showing an increase in optimism after gratitude practice. Finally, we simulate a modified version of the Yarbus eye movement task and find that gratitude practice may affect habitual attention patterns, such that agents attend to more positive elements compared to neutral or negative elements in a painting after gratitude practice. Our model provides a conceptual understanding of gratitude practice that can be used in future research to gain insights into who may benefit from gratitude practice, and why some individuals may not.</p>",

      "abstract": "Hippocampal replay is a widely studied phenomenon wherein special neurons of the hippocampus encoding spacial locations – place cells – show a sequential reactivation during periods of immobility, often representing trajectories to or from reward locations, as observed in foraging rodents. Several computational models have been proposed to explain how this phenomenon could contribute to memory consolidation and action planning. However, certain aspects of the mechanism behind hippocampal replay remain unclear, such as why reactivation is biased towards both reward sites and decision points. Here, we propose that both expected reward (satisfying hunger) and expected information gain (satisfying curiosity) contribute to determine the priority of events to be replayed. To test this, we present the Epistemic Replay Algorithm (ERA), which bridges reinforcement learning and active inference into a single computational model. We evaluate the ERA in five experiments spanning three maze types: linear maze, non-stationary maze, double T-maze. Our results first showcase that more curious agents explore more thoroughly while they are still capable of exploiting optimal rewards; and they can adapt faster to changing environments. Further, we find that the ERA model accounts for a larger number of hippocampal replay properties compared to non-curious models, including (i) a broad-to-specific progression of hippocampal replay events; (ii) symmetric replay around decision points; and (iii) the preferential reactivation of both reward sites and decision points. We derive new predictions to further test the model and discuss its implications compared to alternative accounts.",

      "abstract": "Contemporary psychiatry faces the challenge of overcoming the significant heterogeneity within existing diagnostic categories. Mechanistic, transdiagnostic models are crucial for the development of genuine precision psychiatry. This article proposes a novel, integrative multi-scale model that conceptualizes mental health and illness as the result of the brain's dynamic alignment with its environment. We argue that spatiotemporal dynamics represent the \"common currency\" in this world-brain relation (Northoff). The mechanism that accomplishes this alignment is Active Inference, maintained by a critical balance between a predictive, excitatory (E) and a corrective, inhibitory (I) control system (Friston, Tucker &amp; Luu). A dysregulation of this mechanism manifests at the macroscopic level in the observable imbalances of large-scale brain networks such as the Default Mode Network (DMN). By defining pathology as a failure of spatiotemporal alignment—which manifests in rigid (\"sub-critical\") or chaotic (\"super-critical\") states—our framework provides a causal chain from the fundamental brain-environment relationship to the clinical symptom. This redefinition of pathology as a dynamic 'mal-alignment' simultaneously illuminates the path to healing: a targeted process of restoring this very alignment, leading from manifest network dysfunction back to mental health. We discuss the implications of this approach for defining transdiagnostic biotypes and developing dynamics-based therapies.",

By modeling insight as Bayesian model reduction in a modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, we succeed in simulating its distinct affective signature (i.e., its discontinuous nature and burst of confidence) in an artificial agent. In light of those simulations, we regard restructuring as Bayesian model reduction and impasse as a transient state of heightened uncertainty over possible actions.

EBPM posits that familiar inputs trigger direct reactivation of multimodal engrams (sensory–motor–interoceptive–cognitive), avoiding continuous generative simulation and thereby reducing latency and compute. We provide a method-by-method comparison between EBPM and adjacent frameworks—attractor/Hopfield models, Complementary Learning Systems, hippocampal indexing (pattern completion/separation), HTM/sequence memory, Sparse Distributed Memory, memory-augmented neural networks (NTM/DNC), episodic control, metric-learning/prototypical networks, and PC/Active Inference—explicitly identifying (i) shared mechanisms, (ii) additions brought by each prior theory, and (iii) what EBPM adds beyond them. We further present DIME (Dynamic Integrative Matching and Encoding), a hybrid architecture that exploits EBPM’s one-shot recall on familiar inputs and falls back to PC under uncertainty or novelty via a lightweight controller. Across ANN benchmarks (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10) and a virtual robotics obstacle-course, EBPM consistently yields the lowest inference latency on familiar inputs, PC remains more robust to noise/novelty, and DIME adapts between them without sacrificing task performance. Finally, we formalize Algorithm 1 (EBPM) and map each step to prior art (sparse coding and assemblies; lateral inhibition/WTA; attractor-like selection; salience/LC-NE; Hebbian/STDP; hippocampal indexing), clarifying how EBPM integrates classic mechanisms into a unified, multimodal engram framework.

Classifications such as DSM and ICD catalogue symptom clusters but fail to reveal underlying mechanisms. Recent integrative approaches, including the biopsychosocial model and RDoC, have advanced the field, yet psychiatry still lacks a unifying explanatory principle. We propose the Predictive Dysfunction Hypothesis as a conceptual framework—a paradigm rather than a proven theory. It suggests that psychiatric disorders can be understood as variations of a fundamental disruption in the brain’s predictive machinery. From an evolutionary standpoint, the brain’s primary role is not to represent the world accurately, but to anticipate potential dangers in order to ensure survival. When this survival-oriented predictive system becomes miscalibrated, psychopathology may arise. This hypothesis integrates predictive processing and active inference models with clinical psychiatry. Psychosis may be seen as overweighted priors, PTSD as rigid threat models, panic disorder as catastrophic interoceptive predictions, depression as entrenched negative priors, OCD as unresolved prediction errors, autism as overweighted sensory errors, and anxiety as exaggerated threat priors. Like oncology’s unification around disordered cell division, psychiatry may benefit from a unifying lens. The Predictive Dysfunction Hypothesis is offered not as a replacement for existing frameworks but as a conceptual paradigm that invites empirical testing and inspires new ways of thinking about diagnosis and treatment.</p>",

If thoughts and behaviours are inevitable consequences of a continuous chain of cause-effect events, why do we feel free? Here, we propose a neuropsychological model for the experience of free will as a conditioned illusion – a misattribution of causality reinforced through operant learning. Drawing on classical findings such as the readiness potential preceding conscious intention and more recent work on active inference, we argue that the temporal contiguity of premotor and motor activations gives rise to superstitious conditioning, shaping an experience of – and belief in – free will that is compatible with determinism. Sustained by dopaminergic circuits and reinforced by sensorimotor feedback loops, our framework situates free will as an experiential phenomenon rooted in the functional neuroanatomy of learning. We discuss implications for medicine, ethics, law, and suggest conditions under which the experience of free will may be disrupted or restructured by disease, pharmacology, and reinforcement history.</p>",

EC is marked by increased activity in unimodal regions, down-regulation in transmodal regions, subcortex, and brainstem, an expansion of the principal gradient, and decrease in low-order global eigenmodes. Cognitive decoding linked EC to heightened perceptual clarity and attention, least with mental suffering, and co-varied with histaminergic H₃ receptors topology. These findings challenge predictions of Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory, while supporting the Active Inference Framework. More broadly, EC demonstrates that consciousness can cease without global suppression, suggesting a potential 'reset' mechanism that fosters equanimity and the potential for flourishing. <h4>Keywords:</h4> advanced meditation, extended cessation, consciousness, subcortical, brainstem, functional connectivity, chemoarchitecture",

      "abstract": "<p>Active inference provides a powerful framework for understanding how agents perceive, learn, and act by maintaining an internal model of the world. However, most existing implementations rely on generative models that are designed for specific tasks or domains. These task specific models limit the ability of agents to generalise, adapt to new environments, or scale beyond narrow applications.Taking inspiration from the human brain, which appears to solve the problem of generalisation through a combination of modularity, hierarchy, and embodiment, we propose a list of core ingredients. We outline seven core components that we believe are essential for a scalable and reusable generative model, including compositional structure, temporal abstraction, attention and precision, meta-level learning, separation of self and world, and mechanisms for learning model structure itself.The discretisation of these core components hints at the necessity for a series of interconnected generative models organised on a graph-like structure with (some) shared variables, states and parameters, similar to the functional specialisation, integration, and connectivity of the brain. We propose that these components offer a blueprint for constructing intelligent systems that can generalise across tasks and domains.</p>",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background: </h4> /Objectives: The sense of agency (SoA)—the feeling of control over one’s actions and their consequences—is a fundamental aspect of volition, learning, and self-awareness. Disruptions in SoA are implicated in various neuropsychiatric conditions, including functional neurological disorders (FND). In emerging human-machine interfaces (HMIs), preserving SoA is critical for usability and therapeutic impact. This scoping review synthesizes computational models that explain the neural mechanisms underlying SoA and explores their application in the design and optimization of HMIs for both rehabilitation and skill learning. <h4>Methods:</h4> A narrative synthesis of peer-reviewed literature was conducted, focusing on models rooted in predictive coding, Bayesian brain theory, active inference, and linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) optimal control. Simulation studies were also included to illustrate theoretical mechanisms in practical XR-based rehabilitation contexts. <h4>Results:</h4> The review highlights the role of internal forward models, efference copies, and sensory feedback in the generation and regulation of SoA. It shows how Kalman filter and LQG control frameworks model belief updating and motor planning, explaining disrupted SoA in FND and its restoration via hypnotic suggestion and virtual sensory perturbations (exafference). EEG microstate dynamics and directed brain connectivity studies reveal distinct SoA-related patterns differentiating novice and expert performance in skill learning. Key regions implicated include the supplementary motor area, parietal cortex, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex, connected via structural pathways. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Integrating computational frameworks such as active inference and Kalman filtering with causal reasoning (e.g., Ladder of Causation) offers a powerful lens to understand and modulate SoA with exafference. These insights support the co-design of adaptive XR-based HMI systems for neurorehabilitation and cognitive-motor skill acquisition.",

      "abstract": "<p>Flow has been described as a state of optimal performance, experienced universally across a broad range of domains: from art to athletics, gaming to writing. However, its phenomenal characteristics can, at first glance, be puzzling. Firstly, individuals in flow supposedly report a loss of self-awareness, even though they perform in a manner which seems to evince their agency and skill. Secondly, flow states are felt to be effortless, despite the prerequisite complexity of the tasks that engender them. In this paper, we unpick these features of flow, as well as others, through the active inference framework, which posits that action and perception are forms of active Bayesian inference directed at sustained self-organisation; i.e., the minimisation of variational free energy. We propose that the phenomenology of flow is rooted in the deployment of high precision weight over i) the expected sensory consequences of action and ii) beliefs about how action will sequentially unfold. This computational mechanism thus draws the embodied cognitive system to minimise the ensuing (i.e., expected) free energy through the exploitation of the pragmatic affordances at hand. Furthermore, given the challenging dynamics the flow-inducing situation presents, attention must be wholly focussed on the unfolding task whilst counterfactual planning is restricted, leading to the attested loss of the sense of self-as-object. This involves the inhibition of both the sense of self as a temporally extended object and higher–order, meta-cognitive forms of self-conceptualisation. Nevertheless, we stress that self-awareness is not entirely lost in flow. Rather, it is pre-reflective and bodily. Our approach to bodily-action-centred phenomenology can be applied to similar facets of seemingly agentive experience beyond canonical flow states, providing insights into the mechanisms of so-called selfless experiences, embodied expertise and wellbeing.</p>",

      "abstract": "<h4>A bstract </h4> A tradeoff exists when dealing with complex tasks composed of multiple steps. High-level cognitive processes can find the best sequence of actions to achieve a goal in uncertain environments, but they are slow and require significant computational demand. In contrast, lower-level processing allows reacting to environmental stimuli rapidly, but with limited capacity to determine optimal actions or to replan when expectations are not met. Through reiteration of the same task, biological organisms find the optimal tradeoff: from action primitives, composite trajectories gradually emerge by creating task-specific neural structures. The two frameworks of active inference – a recent brain paradigm that views action and perception as subject to the same free energy minimization imperative – well capture high-level and low-level processes of human behavior, but how task specialization occurs in these terms is still unclear. In this study, we compare two strategies on a dynamic pick-and-place task: a hybrid (discrete-continuous) model with planning capabilities and a continuous-only model with fixed transitions. Both models rely on a hierarchical (intrinsic and extrinsic) structure, well suited for defining reaching and grasping movements, respectively. Our results show that continuous-only models perform better and with minimal resource expenditure but at the cost of less flexibility. Finally, we propose how discrete actions might lead to continuous attractors and compare the two frameworks with different motor learning phases, laying the foundations for further studies on bio-inspired task adaptation.",

To capture these abilities, we present a deep hierarchical Active Inference model of goal-directed behaviour, and the accompanying belief update schemes implied by maximising model evidence. Using simulations, we elucidate the potential mechanisms that underlie and influence concept learning in a spatial foraging task. We show that the representations formed-as a result of foraging-reflect environmental structure in a way that is enhanced and nuanced by Bayesian model reduction, a special case of structure learning that typifies learning in the absence of new evidence. Synthetic agents learn associations and form concepts about environmental context and configuration as a result of inferential, parametric learning, and structure learning processes-three processes that can produce a diversity of beliefs and belief structures. Furthermore, the ensuing representations reflect symmetries for environments with identical configurations.",

      "abstract": "Pursuing a precise, focused train of thought requires cognitive effort. Even more effort is necessary when more alternatives need to be considered or when the imagined situation becomes more complex. Cognitive resources available to us limit the cognitive effort we can spend. In line with previous work, an information-theoretic, Bayesian brain approach to cognitive effort is pursued: to solve tasks in our environment, our brain needs to invest information, that is, negative entropy, to impose structure, or focus, away from a uniform structure or other task-incompatible, latent structures. To get a more complete formalization of cognitive effort, a resourceful event-predictive inference model (REPI) is introduced, which offers computational and algorithmic explanations about the latent structure of our generative models, the active inference dynamics that unfold within, and the cognitive effort required to steer the dynamics-to, for example, purposefully process sensory signals, decide on responses, and invoke their execution. REPI suggests that we invest cognitive resources to infer preparatory priors, activate responses, and anticipate action consequences. Due to our limited resources, though, the inference dynamics are prone to task-irrelevant distractions. For example, the task-irrelevant side of the imperative stimulus causes the Simon effect and, due to similar reasons, we fail to optimally switch between tasks. An actual model implementation simulates such task interactions and offers first estimates of the involved cognitive effort. The approach may be further studied and promises to offer deeper explanations about why we get quickly exhausted from multitasking, how we are influenced by irrelevant stimulus modalities, why we exhibit magnitude interference, and, during social interactions, why we often fail to take the perspective of others into account.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a normative framework for generating behaviour based upon the free energy principle, a theory of self-organisation. This framework has been successfully used to solve reinforcement learning and stochastic control problems, yet, the formal relation between active inference and reward maximisation has not been fully explicated. In this paper, we consider the relation between active inference and dynamic programming under the Bellman equation, which underlies many approaches to reinforcement learning and control. We show that, on partially observable Markov decision processes, dynamic programming is a limiting case of active inference. In active inference, agents select actions to minimise expected free energy. In the absence of ambiguity about states, this reduces to matching expected states with a target distribution encoding the agent's preferences. When target states correspond to rewarding states, this maximises expected reward, as in reinforcement learning. When states are ambiguous, active inference agents will choose actions that simultaneously minimise ambiguity. This allows active inference agents to supplement their reward maximising (or exploitative) behaviour with novelty-seeking (or exploratory) behaviour. This clarifies the connection between active inference and reinforcement learning, and how both frameworks may benefit from each other.",

Constraining a target organism's behavior constitutes a mechanism of socially extended active inference, allowing organisms to proactively regulate their inner states through the behavior of other organisms. In this general conception of communication, the type of cooperative communication characteristic of human communicative interaction is a way of constraining interaction dynamics toward the goals of a given joint action by constructing and altering shared fields of affordances. This account embraces a pragmatist view according to which communication is a form of action aiming to influence the behavior of a target, and stands against the traditional transmission view according to which communication fundamentally serves to convey information. Understanding acts of communication as active inference under an ecological interpretation allows us to link communicative and ultimately linguistic behavior to the biological imperative of minimizing free energy and to emphasize the action-oriented nature of communicative interaction.",

We simulated agents that committed to a series of decisions in a social two-arm bandit task before and after social adversity, which precipitated depressive symptoms. Responses to social adversity were modelled under various combinations of social support and pharmacotherapy. The normative depressive phenotype responded positively to social support and simulated treatments with antidepressants. Attracting social support and administering antidepressants also alleviated anhedonia and social withdrawal, speaking to improvements in interpersonal relationships. These results support the EST of depression by demonstrating that following adversity, normative depressed mood preserved social inclusion with appropriate interpersonal support or pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Sequential decision problems distill important challenges frequently faced by humans. Through repeated interactions with an uncertain world, unknown statistics need to be learned while balancing exploration and exploitation. Reinforcement learning is a prominent method for modeling such behaviour, with a prevalent application being the two-step task. However, recent studies indicate that the standard reinforcement learning model sometimes describes features of human task behaviour inaccurately and incompletely. We investigated whether active inference, a framework proposing a trade-off to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, could better describe human behaviour. Therefore, we re-analysed four publicly available datasets of the two-step task, performed Bayesian model selection, and compared behavioural model predictions. Two datasets, which revealed more model-based inference and behaviour indicative of directed exploration, were better described by active inference, while the models scored similarly for the remaining datasets. Learning using probability distributions appears to contribute to the improved model fits. Further, approximately half of all participants showed sensitivity to information gain as formulated under active inference, although behavioural exploration effects were not fully captured. These results contribute to the empirical validation of active inference as a model of human behaviour and the study of alternative models for the influential two-step task.",

Results showed improved tracking and control in goal-directed reaching due to the increased representation power, high robustness to noise and adaptability in changes on the environmental conditions and robot parameters without the need to relearn the generative models nor parameters retuning.",

      "abstract": "Scene understanding and decomposition is a crucial challenge for intelligent systems, whether it is for object manipulation, navigation, or any other task. Although current machine and deep learning approaches for object detection and classification obtain high accuracy, they typically do not leverage interaction with the world and are limited to a set of objects seen during training. Humans on the other hand learn to recognize and classify different objects by actively engaging with them on first encounter. Moreover, recent theories in neuroscience suggest that cortical columns in the neocortex play an important role in this process, by building predictive models about objects in their reference frame. In this article, we present an enactive embodied agent that implements such a generative model for object interaction. For each object category, our system instantiates a deep neural network, called Cortical Column Network (CCN), that represents the object in its own reference frame by learning a generative model that predicts the expected transform in pixel space, given an action. The model parameters are optimized through the active inference paradigm, i.e., the minimization of variational free energy. When provided with a visual observation, an ensemble of CCNs each vote on their belief of observing that specific object category, yielding a potential object classification. In case the likelihood on the selected category is too low, the object is detected as an unknown category, and the agent has the ability to instantiate a novel CCN for this category. We validate our system in an simulated environment, where it needs to learn to discern multiple objects from the YCB dataset. We show that classification accuracy improves as an embodied agent can gather more evidence, and that it is able to learn about novel, previously unseen objects. Finally, we show that an agent driven through active inference can choose their actions to reach a preferred observation.",

      "abstract": "Dispersed multiphase systems are ubiquitous in biological systems, energy industries, and medical science. The distribution transition of the dispersed phase is critical to the properties and functions of the multiphase systems, among which the agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction processes are of most significance due to their impact on the colloidal stability, interface modification, and particle synthesis. To reveal fundamental correlations between the macroscopic particle distributions and the microscopic interactions, general thermodynamic models of the dispersed multiphase systems are needed. Here, based on Meyer's model, which is restricted to binary isotropic mixtures, we propose a novel extended lattice model that can be applied to multicomponent anisotropic mixtures with interfaces considered. For agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction processes, the approximate free energy differences between the initial distribution and the final distribution are obtained. Based on the minimum free energy principle, the above free energy differences are used to derive three criteria for the prediction of the preferable distribution of the system with given interparticle interaction potentials. While the quasi-uniform number density assumption is still required for all the previous lattice models, the long-range interactions neglected by previous lattice models are incorporated. The validity of our model and criteria is verified by many-body dissipative particle dynamics (mDPD) simulations. By tuning the interaction coefficients between mDPD particles, the simulated distribution transitions for all the agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction cases perfectly match the predictions from the three criteria. The good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the mDPD simulation results shows the great potential of our model for applications in various dispersed multiphase systems.",

NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV 23(x) 144-XXX, 2022. Since the late nineteen-nineties, the concept of homeostasis has been contextualized within a broader class of \"allostatic\" dynamics characterized by a wider-berth of causal factors including social, psychological and environmental entailments; the fundamental nature of integrated brain-body dynamics; plus the role of anticipatory, top-down constraints supplied by intrinsic regulatory models. Many of these evidentiary factors are integral in original descriptions of homeostasis; subsequently integrated; and/or cite more-general operating principles of self-organization. As a result, the concept of allostasis may be generalized to a larger category of variational systems in biology, engineering and physics in terms of advances in complex systems, statistical mechanics and dynamics involving heterogenous (hierarchical/heterarchical, modular) systems like brain-networks and the internal milieu. This paper offers a three-part treatment. 1) interpret \"allostasis\" to emphasize a variational and relational foundation of physiological stability; 2) adapt the role of allostasis as \"stability through change\" to include a \"return to stability\" and 3) reframe the model of homeostasis with a conceptual model of criticality that licenses the upgrade to variational dynamics.",

However, when deviations are significant, homeostasis may not be restored by these standard controls. Therefore, a function called allostasis is necessary to maximize the energy efficiency of bodily functions, anticipate changing needs (e.g., a future increase in body temperature or oxygen demand), and regulate the body's state before dyshomeostasis occurs. In terms of the free energy principle (FEP), the expectation to survive (i.e., to stay within established confines and to maintain homeostatic integrity over time) is realized by a hierarchical prediction mechanism. Allostasis requires the integration of exteroceptive, interoceptive, and proprioceptive signals. In this paper, the neural mechanism of allostasis is discussed in terms of the FEP.",

      "abstract": "Living systems are hierarchical control systems that display a small world network structure. In such structures, many smaller clusters are nested within fewer larger ones, producing a fractal-like structure with a 'power-law' cluster size distribution (a mereology). Just like their structure, the dynamics of living systems shows fractal-like qualities: the timeseries of inner message passing and overt behavior contain high frequencies or 'states' (treble) that are nested within lower frequencies or 'traits' (bass), producing a power-law frequency spectrum that is known as a 'state-trait continuum' in the behavioral sciences. Here, we argue that the power-law dynamics of living systems results from their power-law network structure: organisms 'vertically encode' the deep spatiotemporal structure of their (anticipated) environments, to the effect that many small clusters near the base of the hierarchy produce high frequency signal changes and fewer larger clusters at its top produce ultra-low frequencies. Such ultra-low frequencies exert a tonic regulatory pressure that produces morphological as well as behavioral traits (i.e., body plans and personalities). Nested-modular structure causes higher frequencies to be embedded within lower frequencies, producing a power-law state-trait continuum. At the heart of such dynamics lies the need for efficient energy dissipation through networks of coupled oscillators, which also governs the dynamics of non-living systems (e.q., earthquakes, stock market fluctuations). Since hierarchical structure produces hierarchical dynamics, the development and collapse of hierarchical structure (e.g., during maturation and disease) should leave specific traces in system dynamics (shifts in lower frequencies, i.e. morphological and behavioral traits) that may serve as early warning signs to system failure. The applications of this idea range from (bio)physics and phylogenesis to ontogenesis and clinical medicine.",

When seen in this light, regulative development becomes an environmentally-driven process in which \"parts\" are assembled to produce a system with predictable behavior.

      "abstract": "A prerequisite for copying innovative behaviour faithfully is the capacity of observers' brains, regarded as 'hierarchically mechanistic minds', to overcome cognitive 'surprisal' (see 2.), by maximising the evidence for their internal models, through active inference. Unlike modern humans, chimpanzees and other great apes show considerable limitations in their ability, or 'Zone of Bounded Surprisal', to overcome cognitive surprisal induced by innovative or unorthodox behaviour that rarely, therefore, is copied precisely or accurately. Most can copy adequately what is within their phenotypically habitual behavioural repertoire, in which technology plays scant part. Widespread intra- and intergenerational social transmission of complex technological innovations is not a hall-mark of great-ape taxa. 3 Ma, precursors of the genus Homo made stone artefacts, and stone-flaking likely was habitual before 2 Ma. After that time, early Homo erectus has left traces of technological innovations, though faithful copying of these and their intra- and intergenerational social transmission were rare before 1 Ma. This likely owed to a cerebral infrastructure of interconnected neuronal systems more limited than ours. Brains were smaller in size than ours, and cerebral neuronal systems ceased to develop when early Homo erectus attained full adult maturity by the mid-teen years, whereas its development continues until our mid-twenties nowadays. Pleistocene Homo underwent remarkable evolutionary adaptation of neurobiological propensities, and cerebral aspects are discussed that, it is proposed here, plausibly, were fundamental for faithful copying, which underpinned social transmission of technologies, cumulative learning, and culture. Here, observers' responses to an innovation are more important for ensuring its transmission than is an innovator's production of it, because, by themselves, the minimal cognitive prerequisites that are needed for encoding and assimilating innovations are insufficient for practical outcomes to accumulate and spread intra- and intergenerationally.",

We discuss how varying degrees and kinds of flexibility may be adaptive (or maladaptive) in different contexts, specifically focusing on measures related to either more disjoint or cohesive dynamics. While disjointed flexibility may be useful for assessing neural entropy, cohesive flexibility may potentially serve as a proxy for self-organized criticality as a fundamental property enabling adaptive behavior in complex systems. Particular attention is given to recent studies in which flexibility methods have been used to investigate neurological and cognitive maturation, as well as the breakdown of conscious processing under varying levels of anesthesia. We further discuss how these findings and methods might be contextualized within the Free Energy Principle with respect to the fundamentals of brain organization and biological functioning more generally, and describe potential methodological advances from this paradigm. Finally, with relevance to computational psychiatry, we propose a research program for obtaining a better understanding of ways that dynamic networks may relate to different forms of psychological flexibility, which may be the single most important factor for ensuring human flourishing.",

      "abstract": "Tschacher and Haken have recently applied a systems-based approach to modeling psychotherapy process in terms of potentially beneficial tendencies toward deterministic as well as chaotic forms of change in the client's behavioral, cognitive and affective experience during the course of therapy. A chaotic change process refers to a greater exploration of the states that a client can be in, and it may have a potential positive role to play in their development. A distinction is made between on the one hand, specific instances of instability which are due to techniques employed by the therapist, and on the other, a more general instability which is due to the therapeutic relationship, and a key, necessary result of a successful therapeutic alliance. Drawing on Friston's systems-based model of free energy minimization and predictive coding, it is proposed here that the increase in the instability of a client's functioning due to therapy can be conceptualized as a reduction in the precisions (certainty) with which the client's prior beliefs about themselves and their world, are held. It is shown how a good therapeutic alliance (characterized by successful interpersonal synchrony of the sort described by Friston and Frith) results in the emergence of a new hierarchical level in the client's generative model of themselves and their relationship with the world. The emergence of this new level of functioning permits the reduction of the precisions of the client's priors, which allows the client to 'open up': to experience thoughts, emotions and experiences they did not have before. It is proposed that this process is a necessary precursor to change due to psychotherapy. A good consilience can be found between this approach to understanding the role of the therapeutic alliance, and the role of epistemic trust in psychotherapy as described by Fonagy and Allison. It is suggested that beneficial forms of instability in clients are an underappreciated influence on psychotherapy process, and thoughts about the implications, as well as situations in which instability may not be beneficial (or potentially harmful) for therapy, are considered.",

      "abstract": "It is still elusive to explain the emergence of behavior and understanding based on its neural mechanisms. One renowned proposal is the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which uses an information-theoretic framework derived from thermodynamic considerations to describe how behavior and understanding emerge. FEP starts from a whole-organism approach, based on mental states and phenomena, mapping them into the neuronal substrate. An alternative approach, the Energy Homeostasis Principle (EHP), initiates a similar explanatory effort but starts from single-neuron phenomena and builds up to whole-organism behavior and understanding. In this work, we further develop the EHP as a distinct but complementary vision to FEP and try to explain how behavior and understanding would emerge from the local requirements of the neurons. Based on EHP and a strict naturalist approach that sees living beings as physical and deterministic systems, we explain scenarios where learning would emerge without the need for volition or goals. Given these starting points, we state several considerations of how we see the nervous system, particularly the role of the function, purpose, and conception of goal-oriented behavior. We problematize these conceptions, giving an alternative teleology-free framework in which behavior and, ultimately, understanding would still emerge. We reinterpret neural processing by explaining basic learning scenarios up to simple anticipatory behavior. Finally, we end the article with an evolutionary perspective of how this non-goal-oriented behavior appeared. We acknowledge that our proposal, in its current form, is still far from explaining the emergence of understanding. Nonetheless, we set the ground for an alternative neuron-based framework to ultimately explain understanding.",

      "abstract": "What do bacteria, cells, organs, people, and social communities have in common? At first sight, perhaps not much. They involve totally different agents and scale levels of observation. On second thought, however, perhaps they share everything. A growing body of literature suggests that living systems at different scale levels of observation follow the same architectural principles and process information in similar ways. Moreover, such systems appear to respond in similar ways to rising levels of stress, especially when stress levels approach near-lethal levels. To explain such communalities, we argue that all organisms (including humans) can be modeled as hierarchical Bayesian controls systems that are governed by the same biophysical principles. Such systems show generic changes when taxed beyond their ability to correct for environmental disturbances. Without exception, stressed organisms show rising levels of 'disorder' (randomness, unpredictability) in internal message passing and overt behavior. We argue that such changes can be explained by a collapse of allostatic (high-level integrative) control, which normally synchronizes activity of the various components of a living system to produce order. The selective overload and cascading failure of highly connected (hub) nodes flattens hierarchical control, producing maladaptive behavior. Thus, we present a theory according to which organic concepts such as stress, a loss of control, disorder, disease, and death can be operationalized in biophysical terms that apply to all scale levels of organization. Given the presumed universality of this mechanism, 'losing control' appears to involve the same process anywhere, whether involving bacteria succumbing to an antibiotic agent, people suffering from physical or mental disorders, or social systems slipping into warfare. On a practical note, measures of disorder may serve as early warning signs of system failure even when catastrophic failure is still some distance away.",

      "abstract": "Active Inference (AIF) is a framework that can be used both to describe information processing in naturally intelligent systems, such as the human brain, and to design synthetic intelligent systems (agents). In this paper we show that Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimisation, a core feature of the framework, does not lead to purposeful explorative behaviour in linear Gaussian dynamical systems. We provide a simple proof that, due to the specific construction used for the EFE, the terms responsible for the exploratory (epistemic) drive become constant in the case of linear Gaussian systems. This renders AIF equivalent to KL control. From a theoretical point of view this is an interesting result since it is generally assumed that EFE minimisation will always introduce an exploratory drive in AIF agents. While the full EFE objective does not lead to exploration in linear Gaussian dynamical systems, the principles of its construction can still be used to design objectives that include an epistemic drive. We provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanics behind the epistemic drive of AIF agents and show how to design objectives for linear Gaussian dynamical systems that do include an epistemic drive. Concretely, we show that focusing solely on epistemics and dispensing with goal-directed terms leads to a form of maximum entropy exploration that is heavily dependent on the type of control signals driving the system. Additive controls do not permit such exploration. From a practical point of view this is an important result since linear Gaussian dynamical systems with additive controls are an extensively used model class, encompassing for instance Linear Quadratic Gaussian controllers. On the other hand, linear Gaussian dynamical systems driven by multiplicative controls such as switching transition matrices do permit an exploratory drive.",

      "abstract": "During communication, humans express their emotional states using various modalities (e.g., facial expressions and gestures), and they estimate the emotional states of others by paying attention to multimodal signals. To ensure that a communication robot with limited resources can pay attention to such multimodal signals, the main challenge involves selecting the most effective modalities among those expressed. In this study, we propose an active perception method that involves selecting the most informative modalities using a criterion based on energy minimization. This energy-based model can learn the probability of the network state using energy values, whereby a lower energy value represents a higher probability of the state. A multimodal deep belief network, which is an energy-based model, was employed to represent the relationships between the emotional states and multimodal sensory signals. Compared to other active perception methods, the proposed approach demonstrated improved accuracy using limited information in several contexts associated with affective human-robot interaction. We present the differences and advantages of our method compared to other methods through mathematical formulations using, for example, information gain as a criterion. Further, we evaluate performance of our method, as pertains to active inference, which is based on the free energy principle. Consequently, we establish that our method demonstrated superior performance in tasks associated with mutually correlated multimodal information.",

In this article, I argue that these approaches adhere to an essentialist view of learning that avoids the question why information seeking should be favorable in the first place. I propose a selectionist account of adaptive behavior that explains why individuals behave as if they had a tendency to seek information without resorting to essentialist explanations. I develop my argument using a formal selectionist framework for adaptive behavior, the multilevel model of behavioral selection (MLBS). The MLBS has been introduced recently as a formal theory of behavioral selection that links reinforcement learning to natural selection within a single unified model. I show that the MLBS implies an average gain in information about the availability of reinforcement. Formally, this means that behavior reaches an equilibrium state, if and only if the Fisher information of the conditional probability of reinforcement is maximized. This coincides with a reduction in the randomness of the expected environmental feedback as captured by the information theoretic concept of expected surprise (i.e., entropy). ",

      "abstract": "Active inference theory (AIT) is a corollary of the free-energy principle, which formalizes cognition of living system's autopoietic organization. AIT comprises specialist terminology and mathematics used in theoretical neurobiology. Yet, active inference is common practice in human organizations, such as private companies, public institutions, and not-for-profits. Active inference encompasses three interrelated types of actions, which are carried out to minimize uncertainty about how organizations will survive. The three types of action are updating work beliefs, shifting work attention, and/or changing how work is performed. Accordingly, an alternative starting point for grasping active inference, rather than trying to understand AIT specialist terminology and mathematics, is to reflect upon lived experience. In other words, grasping active inference through autoethnographic research. In this short communication paper, accessing AIT through autoethnography is explained in terms of active inference in existing organizational practice (implicit active inference), new organizational methodologies that are informed by AIT (deliberative active inference), and combining implicit and deliberative active inference. In addition, these autoethnographic options for grasping AIT are related to generative learning.",

Under the free energy principle, neural correlates should be defined in terms of neural dynamics, not neural states, and should be complemented by research on computational correlates of consciousness – defined in terms of probabilities encoded by neural states.\r\nWe argue that these restrictions brighten the prospects of a computational explanation of consciousness, by addressing two central problems. The first is to account for consciousness in the absence of sensory stimulation and behaviour. The second is to allow for the possibility of systems that implement computations associated with consciousness, without being conscious, which requires differentiating between computational systems that merely simulate conscious beings and computational systems that are conscious in and of themselves.\r\nGiven the notion of computation entailed by the free energy principle, we derive constraints on the ascription of consciousness in controversial cases (e.g., in the absence of sensory stimulation and behaviour). We show that this also has implications for what it means to be, as opposed to merely simulate a conscious system.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThe notion of a physiological individuals has been developed and applied in the philosophy of biology to understand symbiosis, an understanding of which is key to theorising about the major transition in evolution from multi-organismality to multi-cellularity. The paper begins by asking what such symbiotic individuals can help to reveal about a possible transition in the evolution of cognition. Such a transition marks the movement from cooperating individual biological cognizers to a functionally integrated cognizing unit. Somewhere along the way, did such cognizing units simultaneously have cognizers as parts? Expanding upon the multiscale integration view of the Free Energy Principle, this paper develops an account of reciprocal integration, demonstrating how some coupled biological cognizing systems, when certain constraints are met, can result in a cognizing unit that is in ways greater than the sum of its cognizing parts. Symbiosis between V. Fischeri bacteria and the bobtail squid is used to provide an illustration this account. A novel manner of conceptualizing biological cognizers as gradient is then suggested. Lastly it is argued that the reason why the notion of ontologically nested cognizers may be unintuitive stems from the fact that our folk-psychology notion of what a cognizer is has been deeply influenced by our folk-biological manner of understanding biological individuals as units of reproduction.",

      "abstract": "The immune system is a central component of organismic function in humans. This paper addresses self-organization of biological systems in relation to-and nested within-other biological systems in pregnancy. Pregnancy constitutes a fundamental state for human embodiment and a key step in the evolution and conservation of our species. While not all humans can be pregnant, our initial state of emerging and growing within another person's body is universal. Hence, the pregnant state does not concern some individuals but all individuals. Indeed, the hierarchical relationship in pregnancy reflects an even earlier autopoietic process in the embryo by which the number of individuals in a single blastoderm is dynamically determined by cell- interactions. The relationship and the interactions between the two self-organizing systems during pregnancy may play a pivotal role in understanding the nature of biological self-organization per se in humans. Specifically, we consider the role of the immune system in biological self-organization in addition to neural/brain systems that furnish us with a sense of self. We examine the complex case of pregnancy, whereby two immune systems need to negotiate the exchange of resources and information in order to maintain viable self-regulation of nested systems. We conclude with a proposal for the mechanisms-that scaffold the complex relationship between two self-organising systems in pregnancy-through the lens of the Active Inference, with a focus on shared Markov blankets.",

      "abstract": "The action observation network (AON) has been extensively studied using short, isolated motor acts. How activity in the network is altered when these isolated acts are embedded in meaningful sequences of actions remains poorly understood. Here we utilized intracranial electrocorticography to characterize how the exchange of information across key nodes of the AON-the precentral, supramarginal, and visual cortices-is affected by such embedding and the resulting predictability. We found more top-down beta oscillation from precentral to supramarginal contacts during the observation of predictable actions in meaningful sequences compared to the same actions in randomized, and hence less predictable, order. In addition, we find that expectations enabled by the embedding lead to a suppression of bottom-up visual responses in the high-gamma range in visual areas. These results, in line with predictive coding, inform how nodes of the AON integrate information to process the actions of others.",

      "abstract": "The predictive processing framework includes a broad set of ideas, which might be articulated and developed in a variety of ways, concerning how the brain may leverage predictive models when implementing perception, cognition, decision-making, and motor control. This article provides an up-to-date introduction to the two most influential theories within this framework: predictive coding and active inference. The first half of the paper (Sections 2-5) reviews the evolution of predictive coding, from early ideas about efficient coding in the visual system to a more general model encompassing perception, cognition, and motor control. The theory is characterized in terms of the claims it makes at Marr's computational, algorithmic, and implementation levels of description, and the conceptual and mathematical connections between predictive coding, Bayesian inference, and variational free energy (a quantity jointly evaluating model accuracy and complexity) are explored. The second half of the paper (Sections 6-8) turns to recent theories of active inference. Like predictive coding, active inference models assume that perceptual and learning processes minimize variational free energy as a means of approximating Bayesian inference in a biologically plausible manner. However, these models focus primarily on planning and decision-making processes that predictive coding models were not developed to address. Under active inference, an agent evaluates potential plans (action sequences) based on their expected free energy (a quantity that combines anticipated reward and information gain). The agent is assumed to represent the world as a partially observable Markov decision process with discrete time and discrete states. Current research applications of active inference models are described, including a range of simulation work, as well as studies fitting models to empirical data. The paper concludes by considering future research directions that will be important for further development of both models.",

Specifically, the increased energy density and gravimetric energy density of anode‐free cells versus their reduced cycle life when compared with standard lithium‐ion batteries (LIB). In this perspective, a multifaceted comparison between anode‐free batteries with current LIB and future Li metal‐based batteries is shown.

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Antidepressant medication adherence is among the most important problems in health care worldwide. Interventions designed to increase adherence have largely failed, pointing toward a critical need to better understand the underlying decision-making processes that contribute to adherence. A computational decision-making model that integrates empirical data with a fundamental action selection principle could be pragmatically useful in 1) making individual-level predictions about adherence and 2) providing an explanatory framework that improves our understanding of nonadherence.<h4>Methods</h4>Here we formulated a partially observable Markov decision process model based on the active inference framework that can simulate several processes that plausibly influence adherence decisions.<h4>Results</h4>Using model simulations of the day-to-day decisions to take a prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, we show that several distinct parameters in the model can influence adherence decisions in predictable ways. These parameters include differences in policy depth (i.e., how far into the future one considers when deciding), decision uncertainty, beliefs about the predictability (stochasticity) of symptoms, beliefs about the magnitude and time course of symptom reductions and side effects, and strength of medication-taking habits that one has acquired.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Clarifying these influential factors will be an important first step toward empirically determining which factors are contributing to nonadherence to antidepressants in individual patients. The model can also be seamlessly extended to simulate adherence to other medications (by incorporating the known symptom reduction and side effect trajectories of those medications), with the potential promise of identifying which treatments may be best suited for different patients.",

To this end, capturing an accurate statistical structure from observational data provides useful inductive biases that can be transferred to novel environments. Here, we tackle the problem of learning to control dynamical systems by applying Bayesian nonparametric methods, which is applied to solve visual servoing tasks. This is accomplished by first learning a state space representation, then inferring environmental dynamics and improving the policies through imagined future trajectories. Bayesian nonparametric models provide automatic model adaptation, which not only combats underfitting and overfitting, but also allows the model's unbounded dimension to be both flexible and computationally tractable. By employing Gaussian processes to discover latent world dynamics, we mitigate common data efficiency issues observed in reinforcement learning and avoid introducing explicit model bias by describing the system's dynamics. Our algorithm jointly learns a world model and policy by optimizing a variational lower bound of a log-likelihood with respect to the expected free energy minimization objective function. Finally, we compare the performance of our model with the state-of-the-art alternatives for continuous control tasks in simulated environments.",

This work varies the electrophilicity of para-substituents to OPP and probes the dependence of rate coefficients and interfragment interactions on the substituent Hammett parameter, σ<sub><i>p</i></sub>, using constrained density functional theory (CDFT) and energy decomposition analysis (EDA). Large electronic couplings across substituents indicates an adiabatic electron transfer process for reactants at contact. As one might intuitively expect, free energy changes dominate trends in ET rate coefficients in most cases, and rates increase with substituent electron-donating ability. However, we observe an unexpected dip in rate coefficients for the most electron-donating groups, due to the combined impact of flattening free energies and a steep increase in reorganization energies. Our analysis shows that, with decreasing σ<sub><i>p</i></sub>, flattening OPP LUMO levels lower the marginal increase in free energy. EDA reveals trends in electrostatics and charge transfer interactions between the catalyst and substrate fragments that influence free energy changes across substituents. Reorganization energies do not exhibit a direct dependence on σ<sub><i>p</i></sub> and are largely similar across systems, with the exception of substituents containing lone pairs of electrons that exhibit significant deformation upon electron transfer. Our study therefore suggests that while a wide range of ET rates are observed, there is an upper limit to rate enhancements achievable by only tuning the substituent electrophilicity.",

We develop an efficient mean field inference algorithm to jointly infer the supervoxel labels, object activations and their occlusion relations for a moderate number of object hypotheses. To scale up our method, we adopt an active inference strategy to improve the efficiency, which adaptively selects object subgraphs in the object-augmented dense CRF.

      "abstract": "Cognitive control is typically understood as a set of mechanisms that enable humans to reach goals that require integrating the consequences of actions over longer time scales. Importantly, using routine behaviour or making choices beneficial only at short time scales would prevent one from attaining these goals. During the past two decades, researchers have proposed various computational cognitive models that successfully account for behaviour related to cognitive control in a wide range of laboratory tasks. As humans operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment, making elaborate plans and integrating experience over multiple time scales is computationally expensive. Importantly, it remains poorly understood how uncertain consequences at different time scales are integrated into adaptive decisions. Here, we pursue the idea that cognitive control can be cast as active inference over a hierarchy of time scales, where inference, i.e., planning, at higher levels of the hierarchy controls inference at lower levels. We introduce the novel concept of meta-control states, which link higher-level beliefs with lower-level policy inference. Specifically, we conceptualize cognitive control as inference over these meta-control states, where solutions to cognitive control dilemmas emerge through surprisal minimisation at different hierarchy levels. We illustrate this concept using the exploration-exploitation dilemma based on a variant of a restless multi-armed bandit task. We demonstrate that beliefs about contexts and meta-control states at a higher level dynamically modulate the balance of exploration and exploitation at the lower level of a single action. Finally, we discuss the generalisation of this meta-control concept to other control dilemmas.",

Positive prediction errors occur when input exceeds predictions, while negative prediction errors arise when input falls short. Specific neurons are theorized to encode negative prediction errors, linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, the information encoded in omission responses remains unclear. We recorded single-unit activity in rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm with varying tone probabilities. We identified neurons selectively responding to omissions, with responses increasing with evidence accumulation and correlating with tone predictability—key characteristics of negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing an asymmetry in error signaling. We propose a circuit model with laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons reproducing this asymmetry. Our model demonstrates that lateral connections enhance precision and efficiency of prediction encoding, supported by the free energy principle.",

      "abstract": "<p>In the Kolmogorov Theory of consciousness (KT), an algorithmic agent is an information-processing system that compresses sensory data into simpler representations to plan actions that optimize its objective function. Algorithmic agents operate under limited data access, finite computational resources, and fundamental limits from the algorithmic information theory (AIT). In this paper, we demonstrate how these limitations naturally give rise to the principles of probability, Bayesian inference, and the concept of emergence within this framework.Using a toy example of an agent compressing data from a large library, we demonstrate how limitations in data access naturally lead to a multi-model strategy, where probabilistic reasoning and Occam's razor emerge as the agent navigates between different models. This process is naturally extended by allowing it to accommodate objective functions beyond compression. Next, we propose a formal definition of emergence from the notions of coarse-graining and Kolmogorov complexity. Due to its limited resources, the agent must employ coarse-graining to transform data that initially appears incompressible into a compressible, aggregate form while retaining a non-trivial structure. The agent must find patterns and operate at some coarse-graining level to ensure survival. Coarse-graining may include various forms of data reorganization, such as spatiotemporal averaging, compressive sensing, and dimensionality reduction techniques.We discuss the connections to other theoretical approaches, such as Jaynes' robot, the Free Energy Principle, and Active Inference. By addressing how an ideal agent copes with the inherent limitations of data access and computational capacity, we provide a unified framework for understanding both probabilistic reasoning and emergence in algorithmic agents.</p>",

Although the temporal structure of the world around us is essential for human decision making, we know surprisingly little about how representation of temporal structure of our everyday environment impacts decision making. How does the representation of temporal structure affect our ability to generate well-timed decisions? Here we address this question by using a well-established dynamic probabilistic learning task. Using computational modeling, we found that human subjects' beliefs about temporal structure are reflected in their choices to either exploit their current knowledge or to explore novel options. The model-based analysis illustrates a large within-group and within-subject heterogeneity. To explain these results, we propose a normative model for how temporal structure is used in decision making, based on the semi-Markov formalism in the active inference framework.

This limitation is especially evident in the treatment of SAD, where cognitivebehavioral approaches often fail to produce long-term results. In this study, we will argue in favor of a new approach as a unifying theory of anxiety formation, emerging in the last decade from the field of computational psychiatry, focusing on the brain’s predictive mechanisms. We will show how SAD can arise from erroneous interoceptive inferences—incorrect predictions about internal bodily states— which lead to unreliable predictions about the social environment. These erroneous inferences reinforce the individual's perception that the social world is unpredictable and that their actions are insufficient to reduce this uncertainty, creating a state of learned uncertainty.</p>",

This hierarchical interplay, mediated by nested Markov blankets and reciprocal message passing, facilitates the emergence of thoughtseeds as coherent neural activity patterns that guide perception, action, and learning. Thoughtseeds, posited as fundamental units of thought, compete for dominance within the Global Workspace, with the dominant thoughtseed shaping conscious experiences and guiding behavior. We present an illustrative mathematical framework grounded in active inference and dynamical systems theory to model thoughtseed dynamics and their contribution to the unitary nature of consciousness. This biologically grounded model offers a novel approach to understanding the organizing principles and emergence of embodied cognition, with potential applications in consciousness, attention, and decision making.",

      "abstract": "Active inference under the Free Energy Principle has been proposed as an across-scales compatible framework for understanding and modelling behaviour and self-maintenance. Crucially, a collective of active inference agents can, if they maintain a group-level Markov Blanket, constitute a larger group-level active inference agent with a generative model of its own. This potential for computational, scale-free structures speaks to the application of active inference to self-organizing systems across spatiotemporal scales, from cells to human collectives. Due to the difficulty of reconstructing the generative model — that explains the behaviour — of emergent group-level agents, there has been little research on this kind of multi-scale active inference. Here, we propose a data-driven methodology for characterising the relation between the generative model of a group-level agent and the dynamics of its constituent individual agents. We apply methods from computational cognitive modelling and computational psychiatry, applicable for active inference as well as other types of modelling approaches. Using a simple multi-armed bandit task as an example, we employ the new ActiveInference.jl library for Julia to simulate a collective of agents who are equipped with a Markov blanket. We use sampling-based parameter estimation to make inferences about the generative model of the group-level agent and we show that there is a non-trivial relationship between the generative models of individual agents and the group-level agent they constitute, even in this simple setting. Finally, we point to a number of ways in which this methodology might be applied to better understand the relations between nested active inference agents across scales.",

These characteristics are then used to make predictions and influence how one interacts with individuals in various social contexts. In this research, we used an active inference framework to explore how humans can assess another person's risk preferences. The active inference learner uses a probabilistic generative model to model others' decision making process and then employs a Variational Bayesian method based on the free-energy principle to invert the generative model. On a trial-by-trial basis, the observer updates the posterior estimate of the other's hidden characteristic via social prediction error, a mismatch between what we predicted and what they chose. The model begins with a high learning rate and gradually reduces it as more trials occur. This reflects that humans learn from examples sequentially, exploring and using the information as they progress. As more data are accumulated from someone who follows a consistent decision-making process, the observer's faith in his own judgments should grow, and he should be less affected by each new observation. Understanding others' risk preference is a complex example of social reasoning. We employed a sequential scenario where an observer watched the other person's choices between a high-risk gamble and a guaranteed small reward. We discovered that the inferential uncertainty that the learner has in trying to estimate the agent's risk attitude, is largely based on the prediction uncertainty accumulated by the observer when attempting to guess the agent's choices.</p>",

The contrast is highlighted between how memory of our spatio-temporal experiences appears to be treated by our brain one way when we are wide-awake and thus well aware of our unfolding personal life-history, and in a different way when, fast asleep, our dreaming dissolves any such awareness and our oneiric self-hood seems different from our real-life self-hood. The difference is considered from two angles. Regarding simultaneous memory-storage for an experience recalled from alternative perspectives, a theoretical possibility is proposed of a pro-system comparable to Cantor Ternary Set topology.

      "abstract": "In this paper we explore the known connection among sustainability, resilience, and well-being within the framework of active inference. Initially, we revisit how the notions of well-being and resilience intersect within active inference before defining sustainability. We adopt a holistic concept of sustainability denoting the enduring capacity to meet needs over time without depleting crucial resources. It extends beyond material wealth to encompass community networks, labor, and knowledge. Using the Free Energy Principle, we can emphasize the role of fostering resource renewal, harmonious system-entity exchanges, and practices that encourage self-organization and resilience as pathways to achieving sustainability, both in an agent and in collectives. We start by connecting Active Inference with well-being, building on exsiting work. We then attempt to link resilience with sustainability, asserting that resilience alone is insufficient for sustainable outcomes. While crucial for absorbing shocks and stresses, resilience must be intrinsically linked with sustainability to ensure that adaptive capacities do not merely perpetuate existing vulnerabilities. Rather, it should facilitate transformative processes that address the root causes of unsustainability. Sustainability, therefore, must manifest across extended timescales and all system strata, from individual components to the broader system, to uphold ecological integrity, economic stability, and social well-being. We explain how sustainability manifests at the level of an agent, and then at the level of collectives and systems. To model and quantify the interdependencies between resources and their impact on overall system sustainability, we introduce the application of network theory and dynamical systems theory. We emphasize the optimization of precision or learning rates through the active inference framework, advocating for an approach that fosters the elastic and plastic resilience necessary for long-term sustainability and abundance.",

Using a recently established reverse engineering technique, we confirm the quantitative predictions of the free-energy principle using in vitro networks of rat cortical neurons that perform causal inference. Upon receiving electrical stimuli—generated by mixing two hidden sources—neurons self-organised to selectively encode the two sources. Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity. These results demonstrate the applicability of the free-energy principle to in vitro neural networks and establish its predictive validity in this setting.",

In order to grasp the root of the problem we consider “primary intersubjectivity” from the standpoint of the Free Energy Principle as developed by Karl Friston. In terms of this principle and concomitant considerations of variational free energy it can be argued that reduction of predictive errors by both early infants and their care-givers is achievable normally by their reciprocal behavioural exchanges.

However, it is unclear how higher cognition, thought, and concept formation should be understood within active inference. In this paper, we argue that active inference has the resources to deliver an account of the Language of Thought. The Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) posits that cognitive processes are underpinned by a symbolic system of internal representations akin to a language (Fodor, 2010). This \"mentalese,\" as it is sometimes referred to, supports the notions of systematicity and productivity, suggesting that thinking operates via syntactic rules and structured symbols, allowing for the capacity to produce and understand novel cognitive constructs (Fodor, 1998). While LoTH fell out of favour, it has had a recent resurgence, and a particularly promising version of it is the probabilistic Language of Thought (pLoT) which adds probabilistic processes to the LoT picture. We argue that the fundamental features of conceptual representation posited by the pLoT can be accounted for in active inference when we consider concepts as built up sequentially through a series of mental actions, or mental action policies articulated in active inference. Once constructed, concepts can be compressed, are then amenable to rapid deployment and can serve as primitives in the construction of more complex concepts.</p>",

We provide simulations of an active inference agent embedded in a virtual environment, we demonstrate that recursive loops of synthetic data generation can lead to a breakdown in conceptualization — 'seeing as' — while enhancing the system’s ability to predict its own observation stream. We argue that this model can characterize the essential features of MPE, including contentlessness, epistemic openness, and the unique valence profile associated with minimal phenomenal experiences.</p>",

These phenotypes, however, still lack the necessary test-retest reliability. In this re-view, we describe recent works unveiling that mind and brain-related computational phenotypes show structural (not random) variation over time, longitudinal changes. Furthermore, we show that these findings suggest that understanding the causes of these changes will improve the con-struct validity of the phenotypes with ensued increase in test-retest reliability.

However, emerging evidence from the fields of predictive coding and active inference offers a novel lens through which to understand ADHD not merely as a disorder of attention but as a distinctive mode of neurodevelopmental variation. This article synthesizes current research and theoretical models to propose a redefined understanding of ADHD. By integrating insights from Ryan Smith, Paul B. Badcock, and Karl J. Friston (2020), we explore the premise that individuals with ADHD exhibit unique differences in how their brains generate and update predictions about the environment, leading to the characteristic behavioral patterns observed in ADHD. We argue that ADHD involves a divergence in the brain's predictive models and its ability to minimize prediction error, impacting sensory processing, attention allocation, and motor control. This perspective illuminates the adaptive aspects of ADHD, suggesting that what are often labeled as deficits could also reflect an adaptive fit to certain environmental contexts, underscoring the role of neurodiversity in human evolution. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of this reconceptualization for clinical practice, including diagnosis, treatment, and support for individuals with ADHD, emphasizing approaches that align with their unique neurocognitive profiles. This article calls for a shift in the narrative surrounding ADHD, advocating for a model that appreciates the complexity and adaptiveness of neurodevelopmental diversity.",

      "abstract": "When modeling goal-directed behavior in the presence of various sources of uncertainty, planning can be described as an inference process. A solution to the problem of planning as inference was previously proposed in the active inference framework in the form of an approximate inference scheme based on variational free energy. However, this approximate scheme was based on the mean-field approximation, which assumes statistical independence of hidden variables and is known to show overconfidence and may converge to local minima of the free energy. To better capture the spatiotemporal properties of an environment, we reformulated the approximate inference process using the so-called Bethe approximation. Importantly, the Bethe approximation allows for representation of pairwise statistical dependencies. Under these assumptions, the minimizer of the variational free energy corresponds to the belief propagation algorithm, commonly used in machine learning. To illustrate the differences between the mean-field approximation and the Bethe approximation, we have simulated agent behavior in a simple goal-reaching task with different types of uncertainties. Overall, the Bethe agent achieves higher success rates in reaching goal states. We relate the better performance of the Bethe agent to more accurate predictions about the consequences of its own actions. Consequently, active inference based on the Bethe approximation extends the application range of active inference to more complex behavioral tasks.",

      "abstract": "Although still not fully understood, sleep is known to play an important role in learning and in pruning synaptic connections. From the active inference perspective, this can be cast as learning parameters of a generative model and Bayesian model reduction, respectively. In this article, we show how to reduce dimensionality of the latent space of such a generative model, and hence model complexity, in deep active inference during training through a similar process. While deep active inference uses deep neural networks for state space construction, an issue remains in that the dimensionality of the latent space must be specified beforehand. We investigate two methods that are able to prune the latent space of deep active inference models. The first approach functions similar to sleep and performs model reduction <i>post hoc</i>. The second approach is a novel method which is more similar to reflection, operates during training and displays \"aha\" moments when the model is able to reduce latent space dimensionality. We show for two well-known simulated environments that model performance is retained in the first approach and only diminishes slightly in the second approach. We also show that reconstructions from a real world example are indistinguishable before and after reduction. We conclude that the most important difference constitutes a trade-off between training time and model performance in terms of accuracy and the ability to generalize, <i>via</i> minimization of model complexity.",

      "abstract": "The free energy principle says that organisms act to maintain themselves in their expected states and that they achieve this by minimizing their free energy. This corresponds to the brain’s job of minimizing prediction error, selective sampling of sensory data, optimizing expected precisions, and minimizing complexity of internal models. These in turn map on to perception, action, attention, and model selection, respectively. This means that the free energy principle is extremely ambitious: it aims to explain everything about the mind. The principle is bound to be controversial, and hostage to empirical fortune. It may also be thought preposterous: the theory may seem either too ambitious or too trivial to be taken seriously. This chapter introduces the ideas behind the free energy principle and then proceeds to discuss the charge of preposterousness from the perspective of philosophy of science. It is shown that whereas it is ambitious, controversial and needs further evidence in its favour, it is not preposterous. The argument proceeds by appeal to: (i) the notion of inference to the best explanation, (ii) a comparison with the theory of evolution, (iii) the notion of explaining-away, and (iv) a “biofunctionalist” account of Bayesian processing. The heuristic starting point is the simple idea that the brain is just one among our bodily organs, each of which has an overall function. The outcome is not just a defence of the free energy principle against various challenges but also a deeper anchoring of this theory in philosophy of science, yielding an appreciation of the kind of explanation of the mind it offers.",

      "abstract": "Human social interactions depend on the ability to resolve uncertainty about the mental states of others. The context in which social interactions take place is crucial for mental state attribution as sensory inputs may be perceived differently depending on the context. In this paper, we introduce a mental state attribution task where a target-face with either an ambiguous or an unambiguous emotion is embedded in different social contexts. The social context is determined by the emotions conveyed by other faces in the scene. This task involves mental state attribution to a target-face (either happy or sad) depending on the social context. Using active inference models, we provide a proof of concept that an agent's perception of sensory stimuli may be altered by social context. We show with simulations that context congruency and facial expression coherency improve behavioural performance in terms of decision times. Furthermore, we show through simulations that the abnormal viewing strategies employed by patients with schizophrenia may be due to (i) an imbalance between the precisions of local and global features in the scene and (ii) a failure to modulate the sensory precision to contextualise emotions.",

The study of active inference processes relies on the definition of a generative probabilistic model and a description of how a free energy functional is minimized by neuronal message passing under that model. This paper presents a tutorial introduction to specifying active inference processes by Forney-style factor graphs (FFG). The FFG framework provides both an insightful representation of the probabilistic model and a biologically plausible inference scheme that, in principle, can be automatically executed in a computer simulation. As an illustrative example, we present an FFG for a deep temporal active inference process. The graph clearly shows how policy selection by expected free energy minimization results from free energy minimization <i>per se</i>, in an appropriate generative policy model.",

      "abstract": "In this review, we relate theoretical work on the importance of surprise in cognition to empirical research relevant to surprise in predator–prey interactions. There have been multiple proposals as to how surprise should be defined and quantified in the context of animal cognition, including contributions from associative learning, information theory, Bayesian inference and the recent framework of active inference. We argue that active inference provides a novel and powerful approach to quantifying surprise and advances the field by revealing how proactive behaviour on the part of predators relates to reducing surprise. The active inference framework encompasses both proximate (e.g. neurobiological) and ultimate (evolutionary) aspects of surprise and brings new insights into key aspects of prey defences that exploit predator surprise. We focus on surprise in defences that involve a sudden change in prey appearance (such as deimatic displays), and in defences that increase prey unpredictability (such as variation in chemical defences). We review literature that have investigated these phenomena and connect them to active inference. We also consider how multiple prey defences impact surprise in predators. Finally, we consider the implications of active inference for future studies of predator–prey interactions, illustrate how this approach can be used to quantify surprise in prey defences and predict predator behaviour, and outline key questions that can be addressed within this framework.

This paradigm comprises different environments (patches) with limited resources that decline over time at different rates. The challenge is to decide when to leave the current patch for another to maximize reward. We chose this task because it offers an operational characterization of impulsive behavior, namely, maximizing proximal reward at the expense of future gain. We use a Markov decision process formulation of active inference to simulate behavioral and electrophysiological responses under different models and prior beliefs. Our main finding is that there are at least three distinct causes of impulsive behavior, which we demonstrate by manipulating three different components of the Markov decision process model. These components comprise (i) the depth of planning, (ii) the capacity to maintain and process information, and (iii) the perceived value of immediate (relative to delayed) rewards. We show how these manipulations change beliefs and subsequent choices through variational message passing. Furthermore, we appeal to the process theories associated with this message passing to simulate neuronal correlates. In future work, we will use this scheme to identify the prior beliefs that underlie different sorts of impulsive behavior—and ask whether different causes of impulsivity can be inferred from the electrophysiological correlates of choice behavior.",

We show how the organised forms of attachment (secure, avoidant and ambivalent) might arise in (Bayesian) infants. Specifically, we show that these distinct forms of attachment emerge from a minimisation of free energy-over interoceptive states relating to internal stress levels-when seeking proximity to caregivers who have a varying impact on these interoceptive states. In line with empirical findings in disrupted patterns of affective communication, we then demonstrate how exteroceptive cues (in the form of caregiver-mediated AMBIANCE affective communication errors, ACE) can result in disorganised forms of attachment in infants of caregivers who consistently increase stress when the infant seeks proximity, but can have an organising (towards ambivalence) effect in infants of inconsistent caregivers. In particular, we differentiate disorganised attachment from avoidance in terms of the high epistemic value of proximity seeking behaviours (resulting from the caregiver's misleading exteroceptive cues) that preclude the emergence of coherent and organised behavioural policies. Our work, the first to formulate infant attachment in terms of active inference, makes a new testable prediction with regards to the types of affective communication errors that engender ambivalent attachment.",

      "abstract": "Experimental and theoretical studies have tried to gain insights into the involvement of the Temporal Parietal Junction (TPJ) in a broad range of cognitive functions like memory, attention, language, self-agency and theory of mind. Recent investigations have demonstrated the partition of the TPJ in discrete subsectors. Nonetheless, whether these subsectors play different roles or implement an overarching function remains debated. Here, based on a review of available evidence, we propose that the left TPJ codes both matches and mismatches between expected and actual sensory, motor, or cognitive events while the right TPJ codes mismatches. These operations help keeping track of statistical contingencies in personal, environmental, and conceptual space. We show that this hypothesis can account for the participation of the TPJ in disparate cognitive functions, including \"humour\", and explain: a) the higher incidence of spatial neglect in right brain damage; b) the different emotional reactions that follow left and right brain damage; c) the hemispheric lateralisation of optimistic bias mechanisms; d) the lateralisation of mechanisms that regulate routine and novelty behaviours. We propose that match and mismatch operations are aimed at approximating \"free energy\", in terms of the free energy principle of decision-making. By approximating \"free energy\", the match/mismatch TPJ system supports both information seeking to update one's own beliefs and the pleasure of being right in one's own' current choices. This renewed view of the TPJ has relevant clinical implications because the misfunctioning of TPJ-related \"match\" and \"mismatch\" circuits in unilateral brain damage can produce low-dimensional deficits of active-inference and predictive coding that can be associated with different neuropsychological disorders.",

The proposal is potentially of interest to theorists from multiple disciplines. But as presentations often make intensive use of mathematical notation, it can be hard to understand, even for experts.

      "abstract": "Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework for modelling the brain that explains a wide range of mechanisms such as habit formation, dopaminergic discharge and curiosity. However, recent implementations suffer from an exponential (space and time) complexity class when computing the prior over all the possible policies up to the time horizon. Fountas et al. (2020) used Monte Carlo tree search to address this problem, leading to very good results in two different tasks. Additionally, Champion et al. (2021a) proposed a tree search approach based on (temporal) structure learning. This was enabled by the development of a variational message passing approach to active inference (Champion, Bowman, Grześ, 2021), which enables compositional construction of Bayesian networks for active inference. However, this message passing tree search approach, which we call branching-time active inference (BTAI), has never been tested empirically. In this paper, we present an experimental study of the approach (Champion, Grześ, Bowman, 2021) in the context of a maze solving agent. In this context, we show that both improved prior preferences and deeper search help mitigate the vulnerability to local minima. Then, we compare BTAI to standard active inference (AcI) on a graph navigation task. We show that for small graphs, both BTAI and AcI successfully solve the task. For larger graphs, AcI exhibits an exponential (space) complexity class, making the approach intractable. However, BTAI explores the space of policies more efficiently, successfully scaling to larger graphs. Then, BTAI was compared to the POMCP algorithm (Silver and Veness, 2010) on the frozen lake environment. The experiments suggest that BTAI and the POMCP algorithm accumulate a similar amount of reward. Also, we describe when BTAI receives more rewards than the POMCP agent, and when the opposite is true. Finally, we compared BTAI to the approach of Fountas et al. (2020) on the dSprites dataset, and we discussed the pros and cons of each approach.",

However, the GAN cannot well handle the restoration task for the free-energy principle-guided NR-IQA methods, especially for the severely destroyed images, which results in that the quality reconstruction relationship between the distorted image and its restored image cannot be accurately built. To address this problem, a visual compensation restoration network (VCRNet)-based NR-IQA method is proposed, which uses a non-adversarial model to efficiently handle the distorted image restoration task. The proposed VCRNet consists of a visual restoration network and a quality estimation network. To accurately build the quality reconstruction relationship between the distorted image and its restored image, a visual compensation module, an optimized asymmetric residual block, and an error map-based mixed loss function, are proposed for increasing the restoration capability of the visual restoration network. For further addressing the NR-IQA problem of severely destroyed images, the multi-level restoration features which are obtained from the visual restoration network are used for the image quality estimation. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed VCRNet, seven representative IQA databases are used, and experimental results show that the proposed VCRNet achieves the state-of-the-art image quality prediction accuracy. The implementation of the proposed VCRNet has been released at https://github.com/NUIST-Videocoding/VCRNet.",

This Review considers possible neuronal substrates underlying the principle. First, the foundations of the free-energy principle are introduced, and then its ability to empirically explain various brain functions and psychological and biological phenomena in terms of Bayesian inference is described. Mathematically, the dynamics of neural activity and plasticity that minimise a cost function can be cast as performing Bayesian inference that minimises variational free energy. This equivalence licenses the adoption of the free-energy principle as a universal characterisation of neural networks. Further, the neural network structure itself represents a generative model under which an agent operates. A virtue of this perspective is that it enables the formal association of neural network properties with prior beliefs that regulate inference and learning. The possible neuronal substrates that implement prior and posterior beliefs and how to empirically examine the theory are discussed. This perspective renders brain activity explainable, leading to a deeper understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying basic psychology and psychiatric disorders in terms of an implicit generative model.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents a model-based defence of the partial functional/informational segregation of cognition in the context of the predictive architecture. The paper argues that the model-relativeness of modularity does not need to undermine its tenability. In fact, it holds that using models is indispensable to scientific practice, and it builds its argument about the indispensability of modularity to predictive architecture on the indispensability of scientific models. More specifically to defend the modularity thesis, the paper confutes two counterarguments that lie at the centre of Hipolito and Kirchhoff's (2019) recent confutation of the modularity thesis. The main insight of the paper is that Hipolito and Kirchhoff's counterarguments miss the mark because they dismiss a few rudimentary facts about the model-based nature of dynamical causal models and Markov blankets.",

      "abstract": "In a framed-tube tall building, shear wall systems are the most efficient structural systems for increasing the lateral load resistance. A novel and simple mathematical model is developed herein which calculates the natural frequencies of such tall buildings. The analyses are based on a continuous model, in which a tall building structure is replaced by an idealized cantilever beam that embodies all relevant structural characteristics. Governing equations and the corresponding eigen-problem are derived based on the energy method and Hamilton's principle. Solutions are obtained for three examples; using the separation of variables technique implemented in MATLAB. The results are compared to SAP2000 full model analysis; and they indicate reasonable accuracy. The computed natural frequencies for structures 50, 60 and 70 storey buildings were over-estimate 7, 11 and 14 percent respectively. The computed errors indicate that the proposed method has acceptable accuracy; and can be used during the initial stages of designing of tall buildings; it is fast and low cost computational process.",

We employ Karl Friston's free-energy principle to show how this phenomenological concept of mood can be smoothly integrated with cognitive neuroscience.

      "abstract": "Although unique expected energy models can be generated for a given photovoltaic (PV) site, a standardized model is also needed to facilitate performance comparisons across fleets. Current standardized expected energy models for PV work well with sparse data, but they have demonstrated significant over-estimations, which impacts accurate diagnoses of field operations and maintenance issues. This research addresses this issue by using machine learning to develop a data-driven expected energy model that can more accurately generate inferences for energy production of PV systems. Irradiance and system capacity information was used from 172 sites across the United States to train a series of models using Lasso linear regression. The trained models generally perform better than the commonly used expected energy model from international standard (IEC 61724-1), with the two highest performing models ranging in model complexity from a third-order polynomial with 10 parameters (Radj2 = 0.994) to a simpler, second-order polynomial with 4 parameters (Radj2=0.993), the latter of which is subject to further evaluation. Subsequently, the trained models provide a more robust basis for identifying potential energy anomalies for operations and maintenance activities as well as informing planning-related financial assessments. We conclude with directions for future research, such as using splines to improve model continuity and better capture systems with low (≤1000 kW DC) capacity.",

      "abstract": "Functional recovery after brain damage varies widely and depends on many factors, including lesion site and extent. When a neuronal system is damaged, recovery may occur by engaging residual (e.g., perilesional) components. When damage is extensive, recovery depends on the availability of other intact neural structures that can reproduce the same functional output (i.e., degeneracy). A system's response to damage may occur rapidly, require learning or both. Here, we simulate functional recovery from four different types of lesions, using a generative model of word repetition that comprised a default premorbid system and a less used alternative system. The synthetic lesions (i) completely disengaged the premorbid system, leaving the alternative system intact, (ii) partially damaged both premorbid and alternative systems, and (iii) limited the experience-dependent plasticity of both. The results, across 1000 trials, demonstrate that (i) a complete disconnection of the premorbid system naturally invoked the engagement of the other, (ii) incomplete damage to both systems had a much more devastating long-term effect on model performance and (iii) the effect of reducing learning capacity within each system. These findings contribute to formal frameworks for interpreting the effect of different types of lesions.",

We\nalso discuss how these errors affect the very similar Friston (2014,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2014.2306251) and, where appropriate, mention\nconsequences for the newer proposals in Friston (2019, arXiv:1906.10184v1 ) and\nParr et al. (2019,\nhttps://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2019.0159). The errors\ncall into question the purported interpretation that the internal coordinates\nof every system with a Markov blanket will appear to engage in Bayesian\ninference. In particular, in addition to highlighting the implicit restriction\nto linear models, we identify three formal errors in the main argument of\nFriston (2013): The first concerns the rewriting of the equations of motion of\nsystems with Markov blankets which turns out not to be generally correct. We\nprove the non-equivalence with a counterexample that exhibits a Markov blanket\nbut does not satisfy the rewritten equations. Our counterexample also\ninvalidates the corresponding (but more general) rewritten equations in the\nmore recent Friston (2019). The second error concerns the Free Energy Lemma\nitself, which we prove, by counterexample, to be wrong in general. The third is\nthe claim that the Free Energy Lemma, when it does hold, implies equality of\nvariational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in\nterms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it\nis unjustified. Additionally, we highlight that the definitions of the Markov\nblanket in Friston (2013) and Parr et al. (2019) are not equivalent and that\nthe assumptions in Parr et al.

      "abstract": "In this paper, the Adaptive Calibration Model (ACM) and Active Inference Theory (AIT) are related to future-proofing startups. ACM encompasses the allocation of energy by the stress response system to alternative options for action, depending upon individuals' life histories and changing external contexts. More broadly, within AIT, it is posited that humans survive by taking action to align their internal generative models with sensory inputs from external states. The first contribution of the paper is to address the need for future-proofing methods for startups by providing eight stress management principles based on ACM and AIT. Future-proofing methods are needed because, typically, nine out of ten startups do not survive. A second contribution is to relate ACM and AIT to startup life cycle stages. The third contribution is to provide practical examples that show the broader relevance ACM and AIT to organizational practice. These contributions go beyond previous literature concerned with entrepreneurial stress and organizational stress. In particular, rather than focusing on particular stressors, this paper is focused on the recalibrating/updating of startups' stress responsivity patterns in relation to changes in the internal state of the startup and/or changes in the external state. Overall, the paper makes a contribution to relating physics of life constructs concerned with energy, action and ecological fitness to human organizations.",

      "abstract": "Jouissance refers to an excess enjoyment beyond (yet tied to) speech and representation. From the perspective of some Lacanian analysts, jouissance is precisely what testifies against any relationship to the brain— jouissance “slips” out of cognition. On the contrary, it is argued here that jouissance has a central place in contemporary neuropsychoanalysis. In part 1 of this series the metapsychology of jouissance was presented in relation to the real and symbolic registers. Here, in part 2, Mark Solms’s neuropsychoanalytic model of Karl Friston’s free energy principle is summarized. In this model, “predictions” aim to resolve prediction errors—most notably, those signaled by affective consciousness. “Surplus prediction error”—prediction error that arises at the point where the predictive model fails—is proposed to be a neural correlate of jouissance. This limit within prediction is analogous to the real as a structural negativity within the symbolic.",

      "abstract": "<p>Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) represents a fundamental problem for autonomous embodied systems, for which the hippocampal/entorhinal system (H/E-S) has been optimized over the course of evolution. We have developed a biologically-inspired SLAM architecture based on latent variable generative modeling within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference (FEP-AI) framework, which affords flexible navigation and planning in mobile robots. We have primarily focused on attempting to reverse engineer H/E-S ‘design’ properties, but here we consider ways in which SLAM principles from robotics may help us better understand nervous systems and emergent minds. After reviewing LatentSLAM and notable features of this control architecture, we consider how the H/E-S may realize these functional properties not only for physical navigation, but also with respect to high-level cognition understood as generalized simultaneous localization and mapping (G-SLAM). We focus on loop-closure, graph-relaxation, and node duplication as particularly impactful architectural features, suggesting these computational phenomena may contribute to understanding cognitive insight (as proto-causal-inference), accommodation (as integration into existing schemas), and assimilation (as category formation). All these operations can similarly be describable in terms of structure/category learning on multiple levels of abstraction. However, here we adopt an ecological rationality perspective, framing H/E-S functions as orchestrating SLAM processes within both concrete and abstract hypothesis spaces. In this navigation/search process, adaptive cognitive equilibration between assimilation and accommodation involves balancing tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation; this dynamic equilibrium may be near optimally realized in FEP-AI, wherein control systems governed by expected free energy objective functions naturally balance model simplicity and accuracy. With respect to structure learning, such a balance would involve constructing models and categories that are neither too inclusive nor exclusive. We propose these (generalized) SLAM phenomena may represent some of the most impactful sources of variation in cognition both within and between individuals, suggesting that modulators of H/E-S functioning may potentially illuminate their adaptive significances as fundamental cybernetic control parameters. Finally, we discuss how understanding H/E-S contributions to G-SLAM may provide a unifying framework for high-level cognition and its potential realization in artificial intelligences.</p>",

Whilst the notion of archetypes has been debated amongst psychoanalytic traditions as well as in contemporary mythology/anthropology, little work has been done on their utility in the cognitive and neurosciences. We propose a novel neural mechanism of archetypes, grounded in cross-cultural psychology, comparative mythology, as well as developmental psychology. The pragmatic function of archetypes may serve as a collective effort of free energy minimization under the free energy principle, emergent due to the sets of affordances offered by culture and ecology. In line with Carl Jung’s definitional scope, we argue that archetypes are rooted in deep ecological and social forces, generationally ingrained for the purpose of optimizing the accurate conceptual representation of agents’ ecological and social environments. We then speculate on theoretical mechanisms by which archetypes are transmitted across time. Finally, we discuss implications for the utility of Jungian archetypes and outline future research directions to expand this concept in the cognitive neurosciences.</p>",

The brain decides on strategies that reduce volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) of future outcomes by minimizing the expected free energy and devises actions, for example, the action to get vaccinated against COVID-19, expecting to avoid getting sick and stay healthy (the desired state). There are basically four options to respond to an action impulse: drop the action, reduce it, increase it, or create a new action.

Loss of control over intact language networks provides a parsimonious starting point that can be tested using in-silico lesions. We simulated a complex recovery pattern (alternate antagonism and paradoxical translation) to test the hypothesis-from an established hierarchical control model-that loss of control was mediated by constraints on neuromodulatory resources. We used active (Bayesian) inference to simulate a selective loss of sensory precision; i.e., confidence in the causes of sensations. This in-silico lesion altered the precision of beliefs about task relevant states, including appropriate actions, and reproduced exactly the recovery pattern of interest. As sensory precision has been linked to acetylcholine release, these simulations endorse the conjecture that loss of neuromodulatory control can explain this atypical recovery pattern. We discuss the relevance of this finding for other recovery patterns.",

      "abstract": "Opinion spam has become a widespread problem in the online review world, where paid or biased reviewers write fake reviews to elevate or relegate a product (or business) to mislead the consumers for profit or fame. In recent years, opinion spam detection has attracted a lot of attention from both the business and research communities. However, the problem still remains challenging as human labeling is expensive and hence labeled data is scarce, which is needed for supervised learning and evaluation. There exist recent works (e.g., FraudEagle [2], SpEagle [19]) which address the spam detection problem as an unsupervised network inference task on the review network. These methods are also able to incorporate labels (if available), and have been shown to achieve improved performance under the semi-supervised inference setting, in which the labels of a random sample of nodes are consumed.In this work, we address the problem of active inference for opinion spam detection. Active inference is the process of carefully selecting a subset of instances (nodes) whose labels are obtained from an oracle to be used during the (network) inference. Our goal is to employ a label acquisition strategy that selects a given number of nodes (a.k.a. the budget) wisely, as opposed to randomly, so as to improve detection performance significantly over the random selection. Our key insight is to select nodes that (i) exhibit high uncertainty, (ii) reside in a dense region, and (iii) are close-by to other uncertain nodes in the network. Based on this insight, we design a utility measure, called Expected UnCertainty Reach (EUCR), and pick the node with the highest EUCR score at every step iteratively. Experiments on two large real-world datasets from Yelp.com show that our method significantly outperforms random sampling as well as other state-of-the-art active inference approaches.MSC codesopinion spamactive inferenceexpected uncertainty reach",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the \"planning as inference\" paradigm has become central to the study of behaviour. The advance offered by this is the formalisation of motivation as a prior belief about \"how I am going to act\". This paper provides an overview of the factors that contribute to this prior. These are rooted in optimal experimental design, information theory, and statistical decision making. We unpack how these factors imply a functional architecture for motivated behaviour. This raises an important question: how can we put this architecture to work in the service of understanding observed neurobiological structure? To answer this question, we draw from established techniques in experimental studies of behaviour. Typically, these examine the influence of perturbations of the nervous system-which include pathological insults or optogenetic manipulations-to see their influence on behaviour. Here, we argue that the message passing that emerges from inferring what to do can be similarly perturbed. If a given perturbation elicits the same behaviours as a focal brain lesion, this provides a functional interpretation of empirical findings and an anatomical grounding for theoretical results. We highlight examples of this approach that influence different sorts of goal-directed behaviour, active learning, and decision making. Finally, we summarise their implications for the neuroanatomy of inferring what to do (and what not to).",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n                  Human upright standing involves an integration of multiple sensory inputs such as vision, vestibular and somatosensory systems. It has been known that sensory deficits worsen the standing balance. However, how the modulation of sensory information contributes to postural stabilization still remains an open question for researchers. The purpose of this work was to formulate the human standing postural control system in the framework of the free-energy principle, and to investigate the efficacy of the skin stretch feedback in enhancing the human standing balance. Previously, we have shown that sensory augmentation by skin stretch feedback at the fingertip could modulate the standing balance of the people with simulated sensory deficits. In this study, subjects underwent ten 30-second trials of quiet standing balance with and without skin stretch feedback. Visual and vestibular sensory deficits were simulated by having each subject close their eyes and tilt their head back. We found that sensory augmentation by velocity-based skin stretch feedback at the fingertip reduced the entropy of the standing postural sway of the people with simulated sensory deficits. This result aligns with the framework of the free energy principle which states that a self-organizing biological system at its equilibrium state tries to minimize its free energy either by updating the internal state or by correcting body movement with appropriate actions. The velocity-based skin stretch feedback at the fingertip may increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensory signals, which in turn enhances the accuracy of the internal states in the central nervous system. With more accurate internal states, the human postural control system can further adjust the standing posture to minimize the entropy, and thus the free energy.",

      "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is currently one of the most promising frameworks with which to address a unified explanation of life-related phenomena. With powerful formalism that embeds a small set of assumptions, it purports to deal with complex adaptive dynamics ranging from barely unicellular organisms to complex cultural manifestations. The FEP has received increased attention in disciplines that study life, including some critique regarding its overall explanatory power and its true potential as a grand unifying theory (GUT). Recently, FEP theorists presented a contribution with the main tenets of their framework, together with possible philosophical interpretations, which lean towards so-called Markovian Monism (MM). The present paper assumes some of the abovementioned critiques, rejects the arguments advanced to invalidate the FEP’s potential to be a GUT, and overcomes criticism thereof by reviewing FEP theorists’ newly minted metaphysical commitment, namely MM. Specifically, it shows that this philosophical interpretation of the FEP argues circularly and only delivers what it initially assumes, i.e., a dual information geometry that allegedly explains epistemic access to the world based on prior dual assumptions. The origin of this circularity can be traced back to a physical description contingent on relative system-environment separation. However, the FEP itself is not committed to MM, and as a scientific theory it delivers more than what it assumes, serving as a heuristic unification principle that provides epistemic advancement for the life sciences.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework in neuroscience that offers a unified theory of brain function. It is also proposed as a framework for planning in AI. Unfortunately, the complex mathematics required to create new models can impede application of active inference in neuroscience and AI research. This letter addresses this problem by providing a complete mathematical treatment of the active inference framework in discrete time and state spaces and the derivation of the update equations for any new model. We leverage the theoretical connection between active inference and variational message passing as described by John Winn and Christopher M. Bishop in 2005. Since variational message passing is a well-defined methodology for deriving Bayesian belief update equations, this letter opens the door to advanced generative models for active inference. We show that using a fully factorized variational distribution simplifies the expected free energy, which furnishes priors over policies so that agents seek unambiguous states. Finally, we consider future extensions that support deep tree searches for sequential policy optimization based on structure learning and belief propagation.",

Active inference finesses the exploitation-exploration dilemma in relation to prior preferences by placing information gain on the same footing as reward or value. In brief, active inference replaces value functions with functionals of (Bayesian) beliefs, in the form of an expected (variational) free energy. In this letter, we consider a sophisticated kind of active inference using a recursive form of expected free energy. Sophistication describes the degree to which an agent has beliefs about beliefs. We consider agents with beliefs about the counterfactual consequences of action for states of affairs ",

It also talks about emissions from electricity and heat production, industry, transportation, and other energy that are caused by extracting, processing, and burning fossil fuels. The chapter highlights that global electricity generation remains dominated by coal, which is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. It highlights the creation of electricity with renewable energy and shift to more heating, transportation, and industry to renewable electricity, which is the great challenge and opportunity of this time on Earth.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to offer a new framework for understanding action, optimization, and choice when applied to economic theory more generally. By drawing upon the concept known as the variational free energy principle, the paper will explore how this principle can be used to temper rational choice theory by re-formulating how agents optimize. The approach will result in agent behavior that encompasses a wide range of so-called cognitive biases, as seen in the scientific literature of behavioral economics, but instead of using these biases as further indications of market inefficiencies or market failures, the paper will likewise attempt to show the limits to which these biases can inform or critique standard economic theory. The paper therefore offers up a \"middle of the road\" approach, in which the neoclassical agent is not quite as \"rational\" as rational choice theory assumes, but at the same time, not quite as irrational as behavioral economics would often have us believe.",

      "abstract": "We present a fundamental description of the electron transfer (ET) step from substituted oligo(p-phenylene) (OPP) radical anions to CO2, with the larger goal of assessing the viability of underexplored, organic photoredox routes for utilization of anthropogenic CO2. This work varies the electrophilicity of para-substituents to OPP and probes the dependence of rate coefficients and interfragment interactions on the substituent Hammett parameter, σp, using constrained density functional theory (CDFT) and energy decomposition analysis (EDA). Large electronic coupling elements across substituents indicate an adiabatic electron transfer process for reactants at contact. As one might intuitively expect, free energy changes dominate trends in ET rate coefficients in most cases, and rates increase with substituent electron-donating ability. However, we observe an unexpected dip in rate coefficients for the most electron- donating groups, due to the combined impact of flattening free energies and a steep increase in reorganization energies. Our analysis shows that flattening OPP LUMO levels lower the marginal increase in free energy with decreasing σp. Reorganization energies do not exhibit a direct dependence on σp. They are higher for substituents containing lone pairs of electrons since substituent orientation varies with OPP charge. EDA reveals that interfragment orbital relaxation, or charge transfer interaction, plays a critical role in stabilizing the vertically excited charge transfer state. Subsequent relaxation to the final state geometry lowers charge transfer stabilization. A concurrent increase in long-range electrostatic interactions is observed, which are more favorable for electron-withdrawing substituents. Our study therefore suggests that while a wide range of ET rates are observed, there is an upper limit to rate enhancements achievable by tuning substituent electrophilicity.",

      "abstract": "This letter offers a computational account of Pavlovian conditioning in the cerebellum based on active inference and predictive coding. Using eyeblink conditioning as a canonical paradigm, we formulate a minimal generative model that can account for spontaneous blinking, startle responses, and (delay or trace) conditioning. We then establish the face validity of the model using simulated responses to unconditioned and conditioned stimuli to reproduce the sorts of behavior that are observed empirically. The scheme’s anatomical validity is then addressed by associating variables in the predictive coding scheme with nuclei and neuronal populations to match the (extrinsic and intrinsic) connectivity of the cerebellar (eyeblink conditioning) system. Finally, we try to establish predictive validity by reproducing selective failures of delay conditioning, trace conditioning, and extinction using (simulated and reversible) focal lesions. Although rather metaphorical, the ensuing scheme can account for a remarkable range of anatomical and neurophysiological aspects of cerebellar circuitry—and the specificity of lesion-deficit mappings that have been established experimentally. From a computational perspective, this work shows how conditioning or learning can be formulated in terms of minimizing variational free energy (or maximizing Bayesian model evidence) using exactly the same principles that underlie predictive coding in perception.",

We used free energy calculations with Einstein crystals as reference states to calculate the difference of antibody binding free energy (ΔΔG) induced by amino acid substitution at each position in epitope B of the H3N2 influenza hemagglutinin, the key target for antibody. A substitution with positive ΔΔG value decreases the antibody binding constant. On average an uncharged to charged amino acid substitution generates the highest ΔΔG values. Also on average, substitutions between small amino acids generate ΔΔG values near to zero. The 21 sites in epitope B have varying expected free energy differences for a random substitution. Historical amino acid substitutions in epitope B for the A/Aichi/2/1968 strain of influenza A show that most fixed and temporarily circulating substitutions generate positive ΔΔG values. We propose that the observed pattern of H3N2 virus evolution is affected by the free energy landscape, the mapping from the free energy landscape to virus fitness landscape, and random genetic drift of the virus. Monte Carlo simulations of virus evolution are presented to support this view.",

We develop techniques within this framework for classifying in an online setting, for example, for classifying the stream of web pages where online advertisements are being served. Stream applications present novel complications because (i) at the time of label acquisition, we don't know the set of instances that we will eventually see, (ii) instances repeat based on some unknown (and possibly skewed) distribution. We combine ideas from decision theory, cost-sensitive learning, and online density estimation. We also introduce a method for on-line estimation of the utility distribution, which allows us to manage the budget over the stream. The resulting model tells which instances to label so that by the end of each budget period, the budget is best spent (in expectation). The main results show that: (1) our proposed approach to active inference on streams can indeed reduce error costs substantially over alternative approaches, (2) more sophisticated online estimations achieve larger reductions in error. We next discuss simultaneously conducting active inference and active learning. We show that our expected-utility active inference strategy also selects good examples for learning. We close by pointing out that our utility-distribution estimation strategy can also be applied to convert pool-based active learning techniques into budget-sensitive online active learning techniques.",

      "abstract": "Influenza virus evolves to escape from immune system antibodies that bind to it. We used free energy calculations with Einstein crystals as reference states to calculate the difference of antibody binding free energy ($ΔΔG$) induced by amino acid substitution at each position in epitope B of the H3N2 influenza hemagglutinin, the key target for antibody. A substitution with positive $ΔΔG$ value decreases the antibody binding constant. On average an uncharged to charged amino acid substitution generates the highest $ΔΔG$ values. Also on average, substitutions between small amino acids generate $ΔΔG$ values near to zero. The 21 sites in epitope B have varying expected free energy differences for a random substitution. Historical amino acid substitutions in epitope B for the A/Aichi/2/1968 strain of influenza A show that most fixed and temporarily circulating substitutions generate positive $ΔΔG$ values. We propose that the observed pattern of H3N2 virus evolution is affected by the free energy landscape, the mapping from the free energy landscape to virus fitness landscape, and random genetic drift of the virus. Monte Carlo simulations of virus evolution are presented to support this view.",

The free energy principle is accordingly rephrased, on autopoetic grounds, as follows: all viable organisms attempt to minimize their sensory uncertainty about an unpredictable environment over a temporal horizon. By taking the variation of informational action, we derive neural recognition dynamics (RD), which by construction reduces to the Bayesian filtering of external states from noisy sensory inputs. Consequently, we effectively cast the gradient-descent scheme of minimizing the free energy into Hamiltonian mechanics by addressing only the positions and momenta of the organisms' representations of the causal environment. To demonstrate the utility of our theory, we show how the RD may be implemented in a neuronally based biophysical model at a single-cell level and subsequently in a coarse-grained, hierarchical architecture of the brain. We also present numerical solutions to the RD for a model brain and analyze the perceptual trajectories around attractors in neural state space.",

      "abstract": "Freud's core interest in the psyche was the dynamic unconscious: that part of the psyche which is unconscious due to conflict (Freud, 1923/1961). Over the course of his career, Freud variously described conflict as an opposition to the discharge of activation (Freud, 1950), opposition to psychic activity due to the release of unpleasure (Freud, 1990/1991), opposition between the primary principle and the reality principle (Freud, 1911/1963), structural conflict between id, ego, and superego (Freud, 1923/1961), and ambivalence (Freud, 1912/1963). Besides this difficulty of the shifting description of conflict, an underlying question remained the specific shared terrain in which emotions, thoughts, intentions or wishes could come into conflict with one another (the neuronal homolog of conflict), and most especially how they may exist as quantities in opposition within that terrain. Friston's free-energy principle (FEP henceforth) connected to the work of Friston (Friston et al., 2006; Friston, 2010) has provided the potential for a powerful unifying theory in psychology, neuroscience, and related fields that has been shown to have tremendous consilience with psychoanalytic concepts (Hopkins, 2012). Hopkins (2016), drawing on a formulation by Hobson et al. (2014), suggests that conflict may be potentially quantifiable as free energy from a FEP perspective. More recently, work by Friston et al. (2017a) has framed the selection of action as a gradient descent of expected free energy under different policies of action. From this perspective, the article describes how conflict could potentially be formalized as a situation where opposing action policies have similar expected free energy, for example between actions driven by competing basic prototype emotion systems as described by Panksepp (1998). This conflict state may be avoided in the future through updating the relative precision of a particular set of prior beliefs about outcomes: this has the result of tending to favor one of the policies of action over others in future instances, a situation analogous to defense. Through acting as a constraint on the further development of the person, the defensive operation can become entrenched, and resistant to alteration. The implications that this formalization has for psychoanalysis is explored.",

It argues that the ‘free principle’ is the soul’s undescended intellectual part, and asks how having such a free principle could be relevant to responsibility. Sections 2 and 3 suggest two answers. (i) Because the human soul has a ‘free principle’, it can achieve freedom by uniting itself with this part. It only needs to focus its attention on the free, self-intellective activity in which it is already, though unconsciously, engaged. (ii) The rational soul’s possession of an undescended intellectual part influences its ability to engage in ordinary reasoning. This suggests that, provided the soul can engage in ordinary reasoning, it will have (even when acting badly) a kind of access to the correct standards in its undescended part.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is an ambitious theory that treats perception, inference, and action selection of autonomous agents under the heading of a single principle. It suggests biologically plausible explanations for many cognitive phenomena, including consciousness. In active inference, action selection is driven by an objective function that evaluates possible future actions with respect to current, inferred beliefs about the world. Active inference at its core is independent from extrinsic rewards, resulting in a high level of robustness across e.g., different environments or agent morphologies. In the literature, paradigms that share this independence have been summarized under the notion of intrinsic motivations. In general and in contrast to active inference, these models of motivation come without a commitment to particular inference and action selection mechanisms. In this article, we study if the inference and action selection machinery of active inference can also be used by alternatives to the originally included intrinsic motivation. The perception-action loop explicitly relates inference and action selection to the environment and agent memory, and is consequently used as foundation for our analysis. We reconstruct the active inference approach, locate the original formulation within, and show how alternative intrinsic motivations can be used while keeping many of the original features intact. Furthermore, we illustrate the connection to universal reinforcement learning by means of our formalism. Active inference research may profit from comparisons of the dynamics induced by alternative intrinsic motivations. Research on intrinsic motivations may profit from an additional way to implement intrinsically motivated agents that also share the biological plausibility of active inference.",

Self-reproduction may be considered the definition of life [5], and the dynamics it induces are of interest to those concerned with living systems from biology to economics. Trajectories of GBM are distributed according to the well-known log-normal density, broadening with time. However, in many applications, what's of interest is not a single trajectory but the sum, or average, of several trajectories. The distribution of these objects is more complicated. Here we show two different ways of finding their typical trajectories. We make use of an intriguing connection to spin glasses: the expected free energy of the random energy model is an average of log-normal variates. We make the mapping to GBM explicit and find that the free energy result gives qualitatively correct behavior for GBM trajectories. We then also compute the typical sum of lognormal variates using Ito calculus. This alternative route is in close quantitative agreement with numerical work.",

      "abstract": "Using advanced molecular dynamics free energy sampling techniques-both classical and ab initio-we analyze the solvation structures of multivalent cations in aprotic solvents. In contrast to previous studies of mono- and bivalent ions in organic solvents, mainly performed using hybrid cluster-continuum quantum chemistry calculations that rely on the assumption of uniqueness of ion solvation free energies, here we find that monatomic bivalent cations may have multiple well-defined minima, as previously reported only for water, or plateaus of free energy with respect to the ion-solvent coordination. These observations are generalized in the concept of the \"ion solvation spectrum\" to highlight the rich phenomenology related to ion solvation as opposed to the normally expected free energy profiles with a single coordination minimum. Specifically, we show that a single chemical species may exhibit a multiplicity of distinctly different electrochemical properties. Using one- and two-dimensional projections of the free energy landscape, we analyze the stability of ion solvation structures and reveal minimum free energy pathways for ion (de-)solvation with low-dimensional approximations to associated kinetic barriers. Unexpectedly, we show that in some cases the process of opening the first ion solvation shell, by removing a solvent molecule, may actually drive the ion into a free energy basin with a higher coordination number. Our study highlights some deficiencies of conventional methodologies for studying ion solvation as a path to determine redox potentials and provides experimentally testable predictions.",

      "abstract": "Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) from high dimensional sensory inputs are often introduced as separate problems, but a more realistic problem setting is how to merge the techniques so that the agent can reduce exploration costs by partially imitating experts at the same time it maximizes its return. Even when the experts are suboptimal (e.g. Experts learned halfway with other RL methods or human-crafted experts), it is expected that the agent outperforms the suboptimal experts’ performance. In this paper, we propose to address the issue by using and theoretically extending Free Energy Principle, a unified brain theory that explains perception, action and model learning in a Bayesian probabilistic way. We find that both IL and RL can be achieved based on the same free energy objective function. Our results show that our approach is promising in visual control tasks especially with sparse-reward environments.",

      "abstract": "The design of multi-stable RNA molecules has important applications in biology, medicine, and biotechnology. Synthetic design approaches profit strongly from effective in-silico methods, which can tremendously impact their cost and feasibility. We revisit a central ingredient of most in-silico design methods: the sampling of sequences for the design of multi-target structures, possibly including pseudoknots. For this  task, we present the efficient, tree decomposition-based algorithm. Our fixed parameter tractable approach is underpinned by establishing the P-hardness of uniform sampling. Modeling the problem as a constraint network, our program supports generic Boltzmann-weighted sampling for arbitrary additive RNA energy models; this enables the generation of RNA sequences meeting specific goals like expected free energies or \\GCb-content. Finally, we empirically study general properties of the approach and generate biologically relevant multi-target Boltzmann-weighted designs for a common design benchmark. Generating seed sequences with our program, we demonstrate significant improvements over the previously best multi-target sampling strategy (uniform sampling).Our software is freely available at: https://github.com/yannponty/RNARedPrint .",

Moreover, we show that the free energies of biological sequences have a smaller variance than random sequences and that the minimum free energy of biological sequences is closer to the expected free energy of the rest of the structures than that of random sequences. These results suggest that biologically functional RNA sequences not only require a thermodynamically stable minimum free energy structure, but also an ensemble of structures whose free energies are close to the minimum free energy.",

When an open system exchanges energy with the outside world (a thermostat) and maintains a constant temperature, its evolution proceeds towards minimizing its free energy. For example, a crystal turns into a liquid when the temperature exceeds its melting temperature precisely because the free energy of the liquid state becomes lower than that of the crystalline state. In the context of dislocation simulations, free energy is all important when one has to decide which of the possible core configurations the dislocation is likely to adopt at a given temperature. ",

This reclassification lies at the heart of long-standing debates questioning whether these modalities should be defined as sensations on their basis of neurophysiological specificity at the periphery or as homeostatic emotions on the basis of top-down convergence and modulation at the spinal and brain levels. Here, we outline the literature on the peripheral and central neurophysiology of pain and pleasant touch. We next recast this literature within a recent Bayesian predictive coding framework, namely active inference. This recasting puts forward a unifying model of bottom-up and top-down determinants of pain and pleasant touch and the role of social factors in modulating the salience of peripheral signals reaching the brain.",

Maximizing expected utility is simply the goal of finding the potential solution whose expected utility value over all possible scenarios is best. Such problems are often approached using coevolutionary algorithms. We are interested in the design of generally well-performing black-box algorithms for this problem, that is, algorithms which have access to the utility function only via input–output queries. We research this matter by focusing on three main questions: 1) are some algorithms strictly better than others when judged in aggregation over all possible instances of the problem? that is, is there “free lunch”? 2) do optimal algorithms exist? and 3) if so, do they have a tractable implementation? For a specific expected-utility maximization context, involving several assumptions and performance choices, we answer all three questions affirmatively and concretely: we provide examples of free lunch; we describe the general operation of optimal algorithms; we characterize situations when this operation has a very simple and efficient implementation, situations when the computational cost can be significantly reduced, and situations when tractability of optimal algorithms might be out of reach.

In order to maximize efficiency, appropriate energy protocols for buildings must be devised and implemented. This study examines predicted and real energy savings, the differences between them, and the methods which might reduce these discrepancies. Analyses for 195 high-efficiency apartment units (certified based on the energy efficiency rating system in use in Korea) indicated an average difference of 23% between predicted and real energy savings. This was found to be due to the fact that predictions failed to take variables such as Heating Type, Corridor Type, and Climate into account. By accounting for these factors, an appropriate calculation formula may be established. Using the revised calculation formula to reevaluate the predicted energy savings of 13 apartment units resulted in a reduction of 7% in the aforementioned discrepancy between predicted and real energy savings. Using the proposed formula to predict energy savings in buildings could improve accuracy, thus facilitating the setting of appropriate standards for restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions of buildings.",

      "abstract": "The free-energy principle is a candidate unified theory for learning and memory in the brain that predicts that neurons, synapses, and neuromodulators work in a manner that minimizes free energy. However, electrophysiological data elucidating the neural and synaptic bases for this theory are lacking. Here, we propose a novel theory bridging the information-theoretical principle with the biological phenomenon of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) regulated by neuromodulators, which we term mSTDP. We propose that by integrating an mSTDP equation, we can obtain a form of Friston’s free energy (an information-theoretical function). Then we analytically and numerically show that dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) influence the accuracy of a principal component analysis (PCA) performed using the mSTDP algorithm. From the perspective of free-energy minimization, these neuromodulatory changes alter the relative weighting or precision of accuracy and prior terms, which induces a switch from pattern completion to separation. These results are consistent with electrophysiological findings and validate the free-energy principle and mSTDP. Moreover, our scheme can potentially be applied in computational psychiatry to build models of the faulty neural networks that underlie the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, which involve abnormal DA levels, as well as models of the NA contribution to memory triage and posttraumatic stress disorder.",

The first peptide, Lac21, exists in mixed monomer-tetramer equilibrium in bulk solution with an appreciable monomer concentration. The second peptide, Lac28, exists as a tetramer in solution, with minimal exposed hydrophobic surface. A kinetic limitation to interfacial adsorption exists for Lac28 at moderate to high surface coverage that is not observed for Lac21. We estimate the potential energy barrier for Lac28 adsorption to be 42 kJ/mol and show that this is comparable to the expected free energy barrier for tetramer dissociation. This finding suggests that, at moderate to high surface coverage, adsorption is kinetically limited by the availability of interfacially active monomeric \"domains\" in the subinterfacial region. We also show how the commonly used empirical equation for protein adsorption dynamics can be used to estimate the potential energy barrier for adsorption. Such an approach is shown to be consistent with a formal description of diffusion-adsorption, provided a large potential energy barrier exists. This work demonstrates that the dynamics of interfacial adsorption depend on protein thermodynamic stability, and hence structure, in a quantifiable way.",

The calculations are based on a stochastic greenhouse damage model in which key parameters are random. This allows a closer representation of current scientific understanding and also enables calculation of a damage probability distribution. Thus, we account explicitly for the uncertain nature of the global warming phenomenon. We estimate social costs of C02 emissions in the order of 20 $/tC for emissions between 1991 and 2000, a value which rises over time to about 28 $/tC in 20212030. Similar figures for CH4 and N20 are also provided. As a consequence of the prevailing uncertainty, the standard deviation of the estimates is rather high. The distribution is positively skewed, which implies that the currently predominant method of using best guess values will lead to an underestimation of the expected costs of emissions.",

Especially, the copper losses in the electrical generator is taken into account, when the electrical power is computed. At first, the controlling force coefficients are discussed to find their physical effects on heaving motion.

On the other hand, psychologists and neurologists report that different frequency and orientation components of one stimulus arouse different neurons in striate cortex. In this paper, a novel reduce-reference (RR) image quality assessment (IQA) metric based on free-energy principle in multi-channel is proposed, which is called MCFEM (Multi-Channel Free-Energy principle Metric). We first decompose the input reference image and distorted image via a two-level discrete Haar wavelet transform (DHWT). Next, the free-energy features of each subband images are computed based on sparse representation. Finally, an overall quality index is received through the support vector regressor (SVR). Extensive experimental comparisons on four (LIVE, CSIQ, TID2008 and TID2013) benchmark image databases demonstrate that the proposed method is highly competitive with the representative RR and no-reference models as well as full-reference ones.",

Hysteresis for the triple-point transition has been measured and found to be the same for niobium-protium and niobium-deuterium. The magnitude of the temperature hysteresis is related to the expected free energy dissipation for the phase transition which occurs through the triple point. The magnitude of the isotope effect for the triple point is considered theoretically.",

The human visual system is not sensitive to the distortion hidden in disorderly regions due to the disorderly concealment effect, i.e. the free‐energy principle. Based on the human visual perception, we introduce a free‐energy based just‐notable‐difference (FEJND) model into the RDO process to adaptively adjust the Lagrange multiplier and quantisation parameter values. Experimental results show that the proposed method conceals more distortions in disorderly regions and achieves 8.46% bit‐rate reduction over the JM reference software at the same perceptual quality level.",

      "abstract": "Computer simulations have long presented the exciting possibility of scientific insight into complex real-world processes. Despite the power of modern computing, however, it remains challenging to systematically perform inference under simulation models. This has led to the rise of simulation-based inference (SBI), a class of machine learning-enabled techniques for approaching inverse problems with stochastic simulators. Many such methods, however, require large numbers of simulation samples and face difficulty scaling to high-dimensional settings, often making inference prohibitive under resource-intensive simulators. To mitigate these drawbacks, we introduce active sequential neural posterior estimation (ASNPE). ASNPE brings an active learning scheme into the inference loop to estimate the utility of simulation parameter candidates to the underlying probabilistic model. The proposed acquisition scheme is easily integrated into existing posterior estimation pipelines, allowing for improved sample efficiency with low computational overhead. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the travel demand calibration setting, a high-dimensional inverse problem commonly requiring computationally expensive traffic simulators. Our method outperforms well-tuned benchmarks and state-of-the-art posterior estimation methods on a large-scale real-world traffic network, as well as demonstrates a performance advantage over non-active counterparts on a suite of SBI benchmark environments.",

In fact, the free energy in a stochastic model derived from a database of small and large subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU and LSU rRNA) data is studied. A common thermody-namic model for computing the free energy of a given RNA secondary structure, as well as stochastic context-free grammars and generating functions are used to derive the desired results. These results include asymptotics for the expected free energy and for the corresponding variance of a random RNA secondary structure. The quality of our model is judged by comparing the derived results to the used database of SSU and LSU rRNA data. At the end of this article, it is discussed how our results could be used to help on identifying good predictions of RNA secondary structure.",

Silicide formation sequence predictions, from the model and the FEDR principle, for 15 metal-Si systems have shown very good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.

Intermolecular cross-relaxation was also investigated by two-dimensional NOE spectroscopy. Information on the distance and order parameter dependence of the NOE's was obtained from a simple simulation of the NOE's in the alkyl chain region. Taken together, the NOE data and the simulation provide strong evidence that TPB- and TPP+, at low concentrations (less than or equal to 10 mol%), are localized in the alkyl chain region of the bilayer. At these lower concentrations of TPP+ or TPB-, no significant effect on lipid 13C T1 or T2 relaxation rates is detected. The proposed location is consistent with the expected free energy profiles for hydrophobic ions and with the carbonyl oxygens or interfacial water as the source of the membrane dipole potential. At higher ion/lipid ratios (greater than or equal to 20 mol%), TPB-/lipid NOE's increase. This results from a specific association of TPB- with the choline head group.",

Usually the dynamical equilibrium of interest is not the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, and does not correspond to a free energy minimum. The relaxation of this type of equilibrium is conventionally considered to be initiated by linear instability. However, there are many cases where linear instability is not present, but the equilibrium is nonlinearly unstable to arbitrarily small perturbations. This paper is about general free energy expressions for determining the presence of linear or nonlinear instabilities. These expressions are simple and practical, and can be obtained for all equilibria of all ideal fluid and plasma models. By free energy, we mean the energy change upon perturbations of the equilibrium that respect dynamical phase space constraints. This quantity is measured by a self-adjoint quadratic form, called {delta}{sup 2}F. The free energy can result in instability when {delta}{sup 2}F is indefinite; i.e., there exist accessible perturbations that lower the free energy of the system. 34 refs.",

The study of active inference processes relies on the definition of a generative probabilistic model and a description of how a free energy functional is minimized by neuronal message passing under that model. This paper presents a tutorial introduction to specifying active inference processes by Forney-style factor graphs (FFG). The FFG framework provides both an insightful representation of the probabilistic model and a biologically plausible inference scheme that, in principle, can be automatically executed in a computer simulation. As an illustrative example, we present an FFG for a deep temporal active inference process.

IWMT further suggests predictive processing in sensory hierarchies may be well-modeled as (folded, sparse, partially disentangled) variational autoencoders, with beliefs discretely-updated via the formation of synchronous complexes—as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs)—potentially entailing maximal a posteriori (MAP) estimation via turbo coding. In this account, alpha-synchronized SOHMs across posterior cortices may constitute the kinds of maximal complexes described by IIT, as well as samples (or MAP estimates) from multimodal shared latent space, organized according to egocentric reference frames, entailing phenomenal consciousness as mid-level perceptual inference. When these posterior SOHMs couple with frontal complexes, this may enable various forms of conscious access as a kind of mental act(ive inference), affording higher order cognition/control, including the kinds of attentional/intentional processing and reportability described by GNWT. Across this autoencoding heterarchy, intermediate-level beliefs may be organized into spatiotemporal trajectories by the entorhinal/hippocampal system, so affording episodic memory, counterfactual imaginings, and planning.",

      "abstract": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is among the world’s most prevalent psychiatric disorders. Affecting an eighth of the world’s population, it often manifests as persistent apprehension which is difficult to control. Despite its prevalence, neuroscientific efforts to understand the cognitive mechanisms of GAD formation remain sparse. This has resulted in a fractured theoretical landscape, lacking a unitary framework. While prior theories of anxiety describe the cognitive, affective and behavioral dimensions of anxiety, a unified theory outlining the formation of GAD remains elusive. Here, we point out that postulates derived from the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and predicting coding may allow for a unified theory to emerge. After outlining the FEP and its suppositions, we review extant work which applies a Free Energy framework to a range of psychiatric disorders. Subsequently, we outline existing theoretical approaches to Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and how they describe its etiology, cognitive architecture, and cognitive machinery. We end with an extension of existing efforts to understand GAD formation, rather than symptomology. We conclude that an approach toward GAD formation may benefit from a focus on predictive modelling, and may afford opportunities to re-conceptualize anxiety within the framework of working generative models, rather than static beliefs. In sum, we suggest that a biological system—having had persistent uncertainty in its past—will iteratively form posteriors in line with uncertainty in its future, irrespective of whether that uncertainty actually persists.  After discussing the FEP, we explain how anxiety develops through learning uncertainty before suggesting predictions for how the model can be tested.",

Double-well simplest information system embedded into the free falling elevator is addressed. Infinitesimal horizontal force applied to the particle m transfers it from position &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; to position &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo;, emerging from the free falling double-well system confining mass m. When thermal noise is considered, the potential barrier of kBT should be surmounted for the erasing of one bit of information. Entropic forces arising in the free falling elevator are considered. The maximal change in the entropy of free-joint polymer chain attached to the free falling elevator is estimated as &amp;Delta;Smax&amp;cong;kB, and it is remarkably independent of the mass attached to the chain and the parameters of the chain itself. Free falling minimal Szilard engine is treated. The informational re-interpretation of the minimal Szilard process is shaped as follows: the energy kBTln2 necessary for erasing of 1 bit of information is spent for lifting up mass, whatever, is the value of this mass. Appropriate choice of frames enables elimination of gravity in the considered system; however elimination of the thermal noise (dissipation processes) by the same procedure is impossible.",

      "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT) are two ambitious theoretical approaches. The first aims to make a formal framework for describing self-organizing and life-like systems in general, and the second attempts a mathematical theory of conscious experience based on the intrinsic properties of a system. They are each concerned with complementary aspects of the properties of systems, one with life and behavior, the other with meaning and experience, so combining them has potential for scientific value. In this paper, we take a first step towards such a synthesis by expanding on the results of the evolutionary simulation study by Albantakis et al. (2014), which show a relationship between IIT-measures and fitness in differing complexities of tasks. We relate some basic FEP-related information theoretic measures to this result, finding that the surprisal of simulated agents’ observations is inversely related to the general increase in fitness and integration over evolutionary time. Moreover, surprisal fluctuates together with IIT-based consciousness measures in within-trial time. This suggests that the consciousness measures used in IIT indirectly depend on the relation between the agent and the external world, and that it should therefore be possible to relate them to the theoretical concepts used in the FEP. Lastly, we suggest a future approach for investigating this relationship empirically.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTInference of active regulatory mechanisms underlying specific molecular and environmental perturbations is essential for understanding cellular response. The success of inference algorithms relies on the quality and coverage of the underlying network of regulator-gene interactions. Several commercial platforms provide large and manually-curated regulatory networks and functionality to perform inference on these networks. Adaptation of such platforms for open-source academic applications has been hindered by the lack of availability of accurate, high-coverage networks of regulatory interactions and integration of efficient causal inference algorithms. In this work, we present CIE, an integrated platform for causal inference of active regulatory mechanisms form differential gene expression data. Using a regularized Gaussian Graphical Model, we construct a transcriptional regulatory network by integrating publicly available ChIP-Seq experiments with gene-expression data from tissue-specific RNA-Seq experiments. Our GGM approach identifies high confidence TF-gene interactions and annotates the interactions with information on mode of regulation (activation vs. repression). Benchmarks against manually-curated databases of TF-gene interactions show that our method can accurately detect mode of regulation. We demonstrate the ability of our platform to identify active transcriptional regulators by using controlledin vitrooverexpression and stem-cell differentiation studies and utilize our method to investigate transcriptional mechanisms of fibroblast phenotypic plasticity.",

Despite their separate origin, they interact with reward processing systems that respond to external stimuli. This paper aims to illuminate the functioning of the needing system through the lens of active inference, a framework for understanding brain and cognition.We propose that need states exert a pervasive influence on the organism, which in active inference terms translates to a “pervasive surprise” - a measure of the distance from the organism’s preferred state. Crucially, we define needing as an active inference process that seeks to reduce this pervasive surprise.Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate that our proposal successfully captures key aspects of the phenomenology and neurobiology of needing. We show that as need states increase, the tendency to occupy preferred states strengthens, independently of external reward prediction. Furthermore, need states increase the precision of states (stimuli and actions) leading to preferred states, suggesting their ability to amplify the value of reward cues and rewards themselves.Collectively, our model and simulations provide valuable insights into the directional and underlying influence of need states, revealing how this influence amplifies the wanting or liking associated with relevant stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Individuals with depressive disorders reveal marked distortions in their social perception and behavior. Self-reinforcing vicious cycles of social avoidance and increasing anxiety can negatively influence the disease’s course. Clinical psychology has offered many explanations as to why these distortions tend to persist in depression, even when the patient’s social context changes for the better. Active inference, a general computational theory of perception, planning, and behavior, has the potential to improve psychological models of depression. Its flexible mathematical formalization offers new avenues towards understanding underlying mechanisms by modelling implicit, inferential processes. We argue that the maintenance of depressive symptoms is primarily due to how (and by what model of the social world) people with depression infer the nature of social contexts through social action (e.g., social decision making). In line with recent work on decision processes, we propose to conceptualize social inference in depression as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). This allows us to formalize different “phenotypes” of social processing and behavior in depression. For example, overly precise, negative prior beliefs about the hidden state of a social context may trigger more pessimistic social decision making in depression, whereas very imprecise prior beliefs should result in more insecure social behaviors. Finally, we outline a research agenda and suggest relevant applications in diagnostics and treatment selection.",

This allows us to understand resilience as the self-maintenance of a non-equilibrium steady-state. This autopoietic steady-state depends on gradient flows that counter entropic dissipation by random fluctuations. These flows can also be interpreted in a statistical sense, which amounts to the claim that resilience depends upon the Earth system possessing a Markov blanket were blanket states (i.e., active and sensory states) separate internal states from external states. Our formalization rests on how the metabolic rates of the biosphere (i.e., internal states) relate vicariously to solar radiation at the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s surface (i.e., external states), through the changes in greenhouse and albedo effects (i.e. active states) and ocean-driven global temperature changes (i.e. sensory states).

In our experiment, 54 children (aged 8.97+-1.11) and 50 adults performed inductive inferences about a series of causal rules through active testing. Children were more elaborate in their testing behavior and generated substantially more complex guesses about the hidden rules. We take a \"computational constructivist\" perspective to explaining these patterns, arguing that these inferences are driven by a combination of thinking (generating and modifying symbolic concepts) and exploring (discovering and investigating patterns in the physical world). We show how this framework and rich new dataset speak to questions about developmental differences in hypothesis generation, active learning and inductive generalization. In particular, we find children's learning is driven by less fine-tuned construction mechanisms than adults', resulting in a greater diversity of ideas but less reliable discovery of simple explanations.",

Associated with improved quality of life, optimism bias is considered to be adaptive and is a promising avenue of research for mental health interventions in conditions where individuals lack optimism such as major depressive disorder. Here we lay the groundwork for future research on optimism as an intervention by introducing a domain general formal model of optimism bias, which can be applied in different task settings. Employing the active inference framework, we propose a model of the optimism bias as precision over a positive outcome. First, we simulate how optimism may be lost during development by exposure to negative events. We then ground our model in the empirical literature by showing how the developmentally acquired differences in optimism are expressed in a belief updating task typically used to assess optimism bias. Finally, we show how optimism affects action in a modified two-armed bandit task. Our model and the simulations it affords provide a computational basis for understanding how optimism bias may emerge, how it may be expressed in standard tasks used to assess optimism, and how it affects agents’ decision-making and actions; in combination, this provides a basis for future research on optimism as a mental health intervention.",

There is no commonly accepted mechanistic model of the alliance. In this paper, we present the alliance in active inference terms as an affiliative behavioral strategy meant to decrease the free energy of the participants’ generative models of each other and of their social exchange. In this view, the initial apprehension of affiliation with a stranger is a normative reaction in the therapeutic (or any social) encounter.

By construction, a statespace representation must account for all determinants of the target system’s evolution, and any change that it does not represent must be held as causally irrelevant. Therefore, although statespace representation appears necessary for formal tractability, it entails the reification of the physical symmetries underlying the target system.This is unproblematic if we hold to the Platonic belief in an ordered, legible universe, whose activity is explained by well-defined “natural laws” imposing observable symmetries onto Nature. However, this idea relates poorly to the life sciences, where the organization that underlies system activity is clearly history-ladden and context-sensitive. More precisely, life and mind seem permeated by the phenomenon of autopoiesis (or self-creation), in which they create their own constitutive symmetries.We discuss here the motivations of law-like explanation, and its intrinsic limitation to account for “creation” in life and mind. We then draft a formal account derived from the Free Energy Principle, rearticulated as a “statespace-free” theory of physical observation grounded in quantum information theory. Finally, we discuss the implication of this treatment for our role as agents in constructing physical reality.",

      "abstract": "AbstractDecision-making is often conceptualized as a serial process, during which sensory evidence is accumulated for the choice alternatives until a certain threshold is reached, at which point a decision is made and an action is executed. Thisdecide-then-actperspective has successfully explained various facets of perceptual and economic decisions in the laboratory, in which action dynamics are usually irrelevant to the choice. However, living organisms often face another class of decisions – calledembodied decisions– that require selecting between potential courses of actions to be executed timely in a dynamic environment, e.g., for a lion, deciding which gazelle to chase and how fast to do so. Studies of embodied decisions reveal two aspects of goal-directed behavior in stark contrast to the serial view. First, that decision and action processes can unfold in parallel; second, that action-related components, such as the motor costs associated with selecting a particular choice alternative or required to “change mind” between choice alternatives, exert a feedback effect on the decision taken. Here, we show that these signatures of embodied decisions emerge naturally in active inference – a framework that simultaneously optimizes perception and action, according to the same (free energy minimization) imperative. We show that optimizing embodied choices requires a continuous feedback loop between motor planning (where beliefs about choice alternatives guide action dynamics) and motor inference (where action dynamics finesse beliefs about choice alternatives). Furthermore, our active inference simulations reveal the normative character of embodied decisions in ecological settings – namely, achieving an effective balance between a high accuracy and a low risk of missing valid opportunities.Author summaryIn this study, we introduce a novel modeling approach to explore embodied decision-making, where decisions and actions occur simultaneously in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional models that treat decision and action as separate, our framework, based on active inference, reveals that crucial features of embodied decisions – such as feedback loops between decision and action dynamics – emerge naturally. By simulating real-time decision-making tasks, we show how organisms continuously refine their choices by integrating sensory information and motor dynamics. This allows them to strike a balance between decision accuracy and the need for fast, adaptive actions. Our model offers a new perspective on how decisions are influenced by the actions taken, highlighting the importance of considering motor control as an integral part of decision processes. This approach broadens the scope of decision-making research and provides new insights into behavior in ecologically valid, time-sensitive contexts, with potential implications for neuroscience, cognitive science, and fields involving human and animal behavior.",

In this framework, the brain encodes a generative model of the causes of sensory observations and continually reduces the surprise (or, more formally, variational free energy) associated with these observations. Our goal is to illustrate how the neuroanatomical and neurofunctional organization of the visuomotor system are emergent consequences of this minimization under the appropriate generative model, while apraxia arises from incorrect parameterizations of the generative model. Our active inference model of the visuomotor pathways provides a unifying perspective on key findings in the neuropsychological literature. By virtually simulating impairments in the model, we explain key aspects of five neuropsychological syndromes impacting cognitive aspects of motor behaviour. This study, therefore, provides a novel hypothesis about the neurocomputational basis of the pathology and offers a formal quantitative approach to aid clinical research.",

One of these is a functional of beliefs about states and policies, but a function of observations, while the second is a functional of beliefs about all three. In the former (expected free energy), prior beliefs about outcomes are not part of the generative model (because they are absorbed into the prior over policies). Conversely, in the second (generalised free energy); priors over outcomes become an explicit component of the generative model. When using the free energy function, which is blind to counterfactual (i.e., future) observations, we equip the generative model with a prior over policies that ensure preferred (i.e., priors over) outcomes are realised. In other words, selected policies minimise uncertainty about future outcomes by minimising the free energy expected in the future. When using the free energy functional – that effectively treats counterfactual observations as hidden states – we show that policies are inferred or selected that realise prior preferences by minimising the free energy of future expectations. Interestingly, the form of posterior beliefs about policies (and associated belief updating) turns out to be identical under both formulations, but the quantities used to compute them are not.",

      "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundAntidepressant medication adherence is among the most important problems in health care worldwide. Interventions designed to increase adherence have largely failed, pointing towards a critical need to better understand the underlying decision-making processes that contribute to adherence. A computational decision-making model that integrates empirical data with a fundamental action selection principle could be pragmatically useful in 1) making individual level predictions about adherence, and 2) providing an explanatory framework that improves our understanding of non-adherence.MethodsHere we formulate a partially observable Markov decision process model based on the active inference framework that can simulate several processes that plausibly influence adherence decisions.ResultsUsing model simulations of the day-to-day decisions to take a prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), we show that several distinct parameters in the model can influence adherence decisions in predictable ways. These parameters include differences in policy depth (i.e., how far into the future one considers when deciding), decision uncertainty, beliefs about the predictability (stochasticity) of symptoms, beliefs about the magnitude and time course of symptom reductions and side effects, and the strength of medication-taking habits that one has acquired.ConclusionsClarifying these influential factors will be an important first step toward empirically determining which are contributing to non-adherence to antidepressants in individual patients. The model can also be seamlessly extended to simulate adherence to other medications (by incorporating the known symptom reduction and side effect trajectories of those medications), with the potential promise of identifying which medications may be best suited for different patients.",

      "abstract": "We introduce and motivate the concept of \\emph{embedded normativity} to account for the externalization of social norms in the material environment through human social activity. We ground this notion in the Active Inference framework, and more specifically through the derived Skilled Intentionality framework of ecological perception and action. This framework considers that skilled agent experience the world as a landscape of affordances, or opportunities for action. This landscape is inherently normative, as its experience is tied to the agent's anticipations over its own behaviour (and therefore, indirectly, to its motivations). We emphasize that given this framework, normativity does not exist inside or outside the agent's boundaries, but is brought about by its engagement with the world. We discuss the dynamics of \\emph{internalization} and \\emph{externalization} by which agents come to project normativity onto elements of their environment, and experience this normativity as a simple attraction toward favoured states. Given this account, we revisit earlier descriptions of the shared material and sociocultural niche enable the broadcasting and integration of norms. Finally, we discuss how embedded normativity can be brought into existence by the perception of humans, and relate our discussion to the ontological stance of participatory realism.",

      "abstract": "The free energy principle describes cognitive functions such as perception, action, learning and attention in terms of surprisal minimisation. Under simplifying assumptions, agents are depicted as systems minimising a weighted sum of prediction errors encoding the mismatch between incoming sensations and an agent's predictions about such sensations. The ``dark room'' is defined as a state that an agent would occupy should it only look to minimise this sum of prediction errors. This (paradoxical) state emerges as the contrast between the attempts to describe the richness of human and animal behaviour in terms of surprisal minimisation and the trivial solution of a dark room, where the complete lack of sensory stimuli would provide the easiest way to minimise prediction errors, i.e., to be in a perfectly predictable state of darkness with no incoming stimuli. Using a process theory derived from the free energy principle, active inference, we investigate with an agent-based model the meaning of the dark room problem and discuss some of its implications for natural and artificial systems. In this set up, we propose that the presence of this paradox is primarily due to the long-standing belief that agents should encode accurate world models, typical of traditional (computational) theories of cognition.",

Participants controlled visual objects via a computer mouse, with tasks designed to test their ability to judge control or detect controlled objects under varying noise conditions. Our findings reveal that participants formed high-level, low-dimensional action plans that were idiosyncratic across but consistent within individuals to infer their degree of control. Employing transformer-LSTM-based autoencoders, we captured these action plans and demonstrated that the geometrical and dynamical properties of these action plans could predict behavioural profiles in the tasks with remarkable accuracy. This suggests that participants’ sense of control is shaped by actively altering action plans, viewed as generating causal evidence through intervention. Further, participants proactively expanded the diversity of their action plans, facilitating the exploration of available action plan options while accumulating causal evidence for the inference process. Contrarily, patients with schizophrenia exhibited reduced action plan diversity, suggesting impaired active control inference and detection of self-relevant cues. These findings offer a more comprehensive understanding of the sense of agency, deeply rooted in the process of active causal inference.",

The Bayes factor (BF) scheme makes use of a time-varying quadratic form over a beam-delay space which in turn offers a simplified approach for the user. The quadratic form is one that is able to reject strong reverberation and noise features while passing aprior highly probable target signature returns. The BF processor exploits the apriori known physical characteristics of the waveguide, such as ambient noise levels and the sound speed profile, to provide prior environmental information to aid detection. The probability distribution of the detection scheme under the composite null hypothesis, the case in which no target is present, is shown to be a superposition of weighted central chi-squared variates with the degrees of freedom being the number of in-phase and quadrature channels of the return path impulse response. The distribution under the composite alternative is a weighted sum of non-central chi-squared variates. These distributions are not simple closed forms but can be well approximated. We consider two such methods of computation and evaluate a number of refractive and scattering regimes. The probability of detection as a function of probability of false alarm under conventional fixed threshold and cost rules are provided to demonstrate the advantage of prior environmental information for the purpose of sonar detection.",

      "abstract": "Trait, attitude and preference learning encompasses the encoding of stable characteristics from observed behaviors, which are then used to make predictions and influence how one interacts with an individual in various contexts. Being able to understand the risk-taking tendencies of others is a complex example of such social inference job. In this research, we used a Bayesian framework to explore how humans can gauge another person's risk-taking tendency. We used a sequential scenario where an observer watched the other person's choices between a high-risk gamble and a guaranteed smaller reward. We proposed an approximate Bayesian observer to assess an agent's risk attitude. This learner utilizes a probabilistic generative model to model the decision making process of others and then employs a variational Bayesian method to invert the generative model. Our research adds to the accumulating evidence that inverting generative models are an essential computing tool for understanding social behavior. The learner updates the posterior estimation of the other's risk attitude on a trial-by-trial basis, with the discrepancy between the model predictions and the choices observed followed the widely accepted prediction error framework namely delta rule. By combining the algorithmic advantages of delta rule with the computational advantage of Bayesian framework, we fashioned a more effective and comprehensible learner. We showed that the accumulated uncertainty the observer builds up while predicting the agent's choices is the main factor that determines inferential uncertainty, i.e., the uncertainty the learner has in estimation of the agent's hidden attitude, which is the impetus for learning and discovery. The model begins with a high learning rate and gradually reduces it as more trials take place. This reflects the way humans learn from examples sequentially, exploring and then making use of the information as they progress. As more data is accumulated from someone who follows a consistent decision-making process, the observer's faith in his own judgments should grow, and he should be less affected by each new observation.",

      "abstract": "Social neuroscience has often been criticized for approaching the investigation of the neural processes that enable social interaction and cognition from a passive, detached, third-person perspective, with participants acting as mere observers of others’ behavior and making judgements based on their observations, without involving any real time social interaction. With the emergence of so-called second-person neuroscience, investigators have enriched the field with findings that evince the unique complexity of neural activation patterns in actual, real-time interaction. This line of work suggests that the kind of social cognition that occurs during social interaction is fundamentally different to that unfolding during social observation. However, it remains unclear how the neural correlates of social interaction are to be interpreted. Here, we leverage the active inference framework to shed light on the mechanisms at play during social interaction in second-person neuroscience studies. Specifically, we show how counterfactually rich mutual predictions, real-time bodily adaptation, and policy selection explain activation in the default mode, salience, and frontoparietal networks of the brain, as well as in the basal ganglia. We further argue that these processes constitute the crucial neural processes that underwrite bona fide social interaction. By placing the experimental approach of second-person neuroscience on the theoretical foundation of the active inference framework, we inform the field of social neuroscience about the mechanisms of real-life interactions. We thereby hope to contribute to the theoretical foundations of empirical second-person neuroscience.",

In this work, we propose that a) the brain only computes imprecise (noisy) estimates of likelihoods and posteriors, and, b) since computations are expensive, the brain actively chooses which computations to perform to refine such estimates. We call our framework approximate inference through active sampling (AIAS) and study its implications in N-alternative categorization. AIAS accounts for several empirical findings. First, we account for a puzzling recent finding that decision confidence follows the difference between the two highest posteriors, rather than the highest posterior itself. AIAS not only provides better fits, but also yields an accurate prediction of response times based on the number of iterations. Second, we show that AIAS is able to explain how categorization behavior changes when the visual contrast varies. Third, we find that the mean response times predicted by AIAS grows approximately logarithmically with the number of categories $N$, as per Hick's law. Overall, AIAS provides a novel approach to explain human categorization by casting approximate inference as an active-sampling process with imprecise computations.",

Building on active inference formulations of dyadic interactions, we simulate linguistic exchange to explore generative models that support dialogues. These models employ high-order interactions among abstract (discrete) states in deep (hierarchical) models. The sequential nature of language processing mandates generative models with a particular factorial structure—necessary to accommodate the rich combinatorics of language. We illustrate this by simulating a synthetic subject who can play the ‘Twenty Questions’ game. In this game, synthetic subjects take the role of the questioner or answerer, using the same generative model. This simulation setup is used to illustrate some key architectural points and demonstrate that many behavioural and neurophysiological correlates of language processing emerge under variational (marginal) message passing, given the right kind of generative model. For example, we show that theta-gamma coupling is an emergent property of belief updating, when listening to another.",

      "abstract": "It is easy to think of attention as a sensory mechanism divorced from the influence of an agent’s preferences and needs. However, according to active inference, such strict divisions cannot be invoked, since all cognitive and behavioural processes can be described as maximising the evidence for an agent’s generative model, which entails preferences that make an entity the thing it is. As such, attention — and perception more broadly — is constrained or enslaved by prior beliefs for which an agent must seek evidence. This paper demonstrates that this imperative is always at play in cognitive systems endowed with attentional schema, and that the preferences in question transcend the contingent, task-relevant goals that bias attention. Rather, attention is powerfully tuned by the most-deep rooted priors the agent possesses, such that, when sensory evidence against these priors is observed and free energy spikes, the agent attentionally prioritises the homeostatic restoration of these preferred states over their shorter-term desires. Thus, at its core, attention is a goal-driven process, which calls into question the putative distinction between endogenous – goal-directed, top-down – attention and exogenous – bottom-up, stimulus-driven, automatic – attention. What emerges in its place is a symbiotic relationship between attention and preferences, whereby the fulfilment of the latter rests on successful application of the former, and the former derives its function from the organismic need to confirm the latter.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n        Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLN) are sensors with limited energy and resources. Sensors deployed in application environment generate large amounts of data. Routing the data with high reliability is a challenging one in LLN. Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is the routing protocol designed for the Internet of Things (IoT). RPL selects the route based on the objective functions - Objective Function zero (OF 0) and Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function (MRHOF). The real-time application environment Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) was considered for this proposed work. The routing protocol used in the real-time reliable environment should route the data with high reliability, so in this proposed work a new objective function Residual Energy based Expected Transmission Count (RE-ETX) is designed for the reliable environment. The objective function RE-ETX was applied to the static and mobile IIoT environment. The RE-ETX is compared with the different objective functions. The results show that the RE-ETX has improved the packet delivery ratio by 6–9% and latency was decreased by 1–3%, hence RE-ETX helps in preserving reliability of the network.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a free energy principle that tries to explain the ability of biological systems to resist a natural tendency to disorder. It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of self-organization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology.",

      "abstract": "We advance a novel active inference model of the cognitive processing that underlies the acquisition of a hierarchical action repertoire and its use for observation, understanding and imitation. We illustrate the model in four simulations of a tennis learner who observes a teacher performing tennis shots, forms hierarchical representations of the observed actions, and imitates them. Our simulations show that the agent's oculomotor activity implements an active information sampling strategy that permits inferring the kinematic aspects of the observed movement, which lie at the lowest level of the action hierarchy. In turn, this low-level kinematic inference supports higher-level inferences about deeper aspects of the observed actions: proximal goals and intentions. Finally, the inferred action representations can steer imitative responses, but interfere with the execution of different actions. Our simulations show that hierarchical active inference provides a unified account of action observation, understanding, learning and imitation and helps explain the neurobiological underpinnings of visuomotor cognition, including the multiple routes for action understanding in the dorsal and ventral streams and mirror mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Research in evolutionary biology and philosophy of biology and cognition strongly suggests that human organisms modify their environment through active processes of niche construction. Recently, proponents of the free-energy principle and variational active inference have argued that their approach can deepen our understanding of the reciprocal causal relationship between organisms and their niche on various scales. This paper examines the feasibility and scope of variational formalisations and conceptualisations of the organism-niche nexus with a particular focus on the extended active inference account. I will draw a conceptual distinction between selective niche construction, developmental niche construction, and organism-niche coordination dynamics and argue that these notions capture different causal patterns, each of which with a distinct scope. Against this background, I will analyse and discuss the extended active inference account and its strategy to integrate variational active inference with work on extended cognition. The proponents of extended active inference assume that their account can provide an explanation of selective niche construction, developmental niche construction, and organism-niche coordination dynamics. However, my key claim will be that this account has the potential to elucidate the workings of organism-niche coordination dynamics, but does not adequately capture the causal patterns of selective niche construction and developmental niche construction.",

      "abstract": "Automated vehicle (AV) technologies promise to improve traffic safety and reduce driver workload in the near future. However, most current implementations have limited capabilities and require transition of control between the vehicle and the human driver during automation failures. For this reason, models of driver behavior have been widely studied to assist the design and development of AV technologies. Recent works have shown that driver behavior models grounded in human cognitive information processing achieve better generalization than prior methods. In this work, we applied active inference, a framework of human perception, cognition, and behavior based on the predictive processing theory, to model driver emergency braking responses to automation failures. We estimated the model parameters from experimental data and examined the model parameters using a factor analysis. We verified the model’s braking response prediction capability in counterfactual scenarios. Our results show that the model effectively captured braking reaction times and provided insight on the correspondence between the variations in driver parameters and behavior.",

      "abstract": "The ability to adapt to a changing environment underwrites sentient behaviour e.g., wearing a raincoat when walking in the rain but removing it when indoors. In such instances, agents act to satisfy some preferred mode of behaviour that leads to predictable states necessary for survival, i.e., states that are characteristic of that agent. In this chapter, we describe how active inference agents, equipped with preference learning, can exhibit these distinct behavioural modes – influenced by environment dynamics – to aptly trade-off between preference satisfaction and exploration. We validate this in a modified OpenAI Gym FrozenLake environment (without any extrinsic signal) with and without volatility under a fixed model of the environment. In a static (i.e., without volatility) environment, preference-learning agents accumulate confident (Bayesian) beliefs about their behaviour and act to satisfy them. In contrast, volatile dynamics led to preference uncertainty and exploratory behaviour. This demonstrates that active inference agents, equipped with preference learning, have the appropriate machinery to (i) engage in adaptive behaviour under appropriate levels of volatility, and (ii) learn context-dependent subjective preferences.",
