Workflow orchestration, progress tracking, and search orchestration.

## Components

- **workflow.py**: `LiteratureWorkflow` for multi-paper operations

- **progress.py**: Progress tracking for long-running tasks

## Quick Start

```python
from infrastructure.literature.workflow import (
    LiteratureWorkflow,
    ProgressTracker

result = workflow.search_and_add(keywords=["machine learning"], limit=10)
```
