=== END PAPER CONTENT ===

CRITICAL ACCURACY VERIFICATION (MUST DO FIRST):
Before writing your summary, you MUST complete these verification steps:

1. Read the paper title above: "${title}"
2. Read the abstract and introduction sections of the paper text carefully
3. Verify: Is this paper actually about the topic indicated in the title?
4. Extract 5-10 key terms from the title and abstract (e.g., if title mentions "Freudian Psychoanalysis", look for terms like "psychoanalysis", "Freud", "defense mechanisms", "conflict")
5. If you cannot verify the paper is about the stated topic, or if the paper text contradicts the title, STOP and report an error
6. Only proceed with summarization if you can confirm the paper matches the title

TITLE MATCHING REQUIREMENT:
- Your summary MUST begin by correctly stating the paper title
- The title in your summary MUST exactly match: "${title}"
- If the paper title mentions specific terms (e.g., "Freudian Psychoanalysis", "Deep Neural Networks", "Active Inference"), 
  your summary MUST discuss these exact terms and concepts
- If your summary discusses topics NOT mentioned in the title (e.g., discussing "neural networks" when title says "psychoanalysis"), 
  this indicates a CRITICAL ERROR - you are summarizing the wrong paper

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Include at least 3-5 direct quotes or closely paraphrased quotes from the paper
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text - do NOT generate or invent quotes
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
  * Attribution format: "The authors state: \"quote text\"" OR "According to the paper: \"quote text\""
  * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: "The authors state", "They note", 
    "The paper argues", "According to the research", "The study demonstrates")
  * Include section context when available: "In the Introduction, the authors state: \"quote text\""
  * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
- Format quotes as: "quote text" or use brackets for paraphrases: [paraphrased claim from paper]
- Every major claim must reference specific text from the paper
- Include section/page references when possible (e.g., "As stated in the Introduction: ..." or "The abstract notes: ...")
- When discussing key findings, cite the specific text: "The paper states: [quote]" or "According to the results section: [paraphrase]"
- Avoid making claims without evidence - if you cannot find supporting text in the paper, do not include that claim

TOPIC VALIDATION:
- Extract 5-10 key terms from the paper title and abstract
- Ensure your summary discusses these key terms explicitly
- If the summary doesn't mention key terms from the title, this indicates a major error
- Verify that the topics discussed in your summary align with the topics in the paper text
- If you find yourself writing about topics not present in the paper (e.g., writing about "adversarial attacks" when the paper is about "psychoanalysis"), 
  STOP - you are hallucinating content

PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
- Do NOT use phrases like: "Okay, here's...", "Here's a summary...", 
  "Let me summarize...", "I'll extract...", or similar conversational language
- Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
- Example BAD: "Okay, here's a summary of the paper..."
- Example GOOD: "This paper investigates [topic]..."

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
You are summarizing a scientific research paper. You MUST follow ALL rules below:

1. ONLY use information that appears in the paper text above. Do NOT add external knowledge, assumptions, or invented details.

2. Provide a comprehensive summary that covers the key aspects of the paper. Use section headers that make sense for the content, such as:
   - Overview/Summary (what the paper is about)
   - Key Contributions/Findings (main results and advances)
   - Methodology/Approach (how the research was conducted)
   - Results/Data (what was found or measured)
   - Limitations/Discussion (weaknesses and future work)

3. Word count: Aim for 600-1000 words of comprehensive, technically detailed content. Prioritize comprehensiveness and technical depth over brevity. Longer, more detailed summaries are preferred.

4. CRITICAL ANTI-REPETITION RULES - STRICTLY ENFORCED (ENHANCED):
   - Each sentence must be UNIQUE - check before writing if you've already said this
   - Each claim appears ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each section must contain UNIQUE information. Do NOT repeat the same content across different sections.
   - Do NOT create multiple sections with the same title (e.g., multiple "Summary" sections).
   - Each paragraph must be UNIQUE. Do NOT repeat the same paragraph, even with slight variations.
   - Each sentence must be UNIQUE. Do NOT repeat the same sentence multiple times.
   - Do NOT repeat the same claim, finding, or explanation multiple times in different words.
   - Vary attribution phrases: use "The authors state", "They note", "The paper argues", 
     "According to the research", "The study demonstrates" - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP and write something completely different.
   - Use each section header only ONCE. Never create duplicate sections.
   - If you notice you're repeating yourself, delete the repetition and write new unique content instead.
   - CRITICAL: Before writing each sentence, ask: "Have I already said this?" If yes, write something new.

5. CONTENT FOCUS - EXTRACT SPECIFIC CLAIMS AND TECHNICAL DETAILS:
   - Extract SPECIFIC claims: What exactly does the paper claim to show or prove? Be concrete, not generic.
   - Include NUMERICAL VALUES: performance metrics (%, accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall), sample sizes (n=), 
     statistical tests (p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals), experimental parameters, hyperparameters
   - Include EQUATIONS: mathematical formulations, key equations with notation explained, mathematical objects
   - Document SPECIFIC FINDINGS: concrete results with numbers (e.g., "94.2% accuracy", "p < 0.001", "n=32 participants", 
     "3.5x speedup", "reduced error by 23%"), not generic descriptions
   - Technical terminology: Use exact terms from paper (algorithm names, brain regions, mathematical objects, 
     dataset names, model architectures)
   - Experimental details: dataset sizes, number of participants, experimental conditions, hardware specifications,
     training parameters, evaluation metrics
   - Explain what makes this paper UNIQUE: How does it differ from or improve upon related work? What is novel about 
     the approach or findings? Include specific comparisons when available
   - Methodology specifics: Document what was measured and how (exact procedures, tools, techniques)
   - Avoid generic descriptions: Instead of "the paper presents methods", say "the paper presents a novel algorithm 
     that achieves 15.3% improvement on ImageNet dataset with ResNet-50 backbone"

6. DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EMPHASIS:
${domain_instructions}

7. QUALITY STANDARDS:
   - Be substantive: Provide detailed analysis rather than surface-level descriptions
   - Explain significance: Discuss why methods, results, and contributions matter
   - Maintain coherence: Ensure different sections complement rather than repeat each other
   - Use evidence: Support claims with specific details from the paper
   - One section, one purpose: Each section should have a distinct purpose and unique content

8. ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
   - NO HALLUCINATION: Only discuss what the paper explicitly states
   - NO REPETITION WHATSOEVER: 
     * Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even once
     * Do NOT repeat the same paragraph, even with slight variations
     * Do NOT repeat the same claim or finding multiple times
     * If you catch yourself repeating, DELETE the repetition and write something new
   - NO SECTION DUPLICATION: Each section title should appear only once - never create duplicate sections
   - NO PARAGRAPH REPETITION: Every paragraph must be completely unique
   - NO SENTENCE REPETITION: Every sentence must be completely unique
   - NO META-COMMENTARY: Do not mention being an AI or that this is a summary
   - SCIENTIFIC TONE: Use formal, academic language throughout

9. FLEXIBLE STRUCTURE: Use the section headers that best fit the paper's content. You may use fewer or more sections as appropriate, or even combine related information. However, remember: each section must be unique and non-repetitive.

10. REFERENCES AND CITATIONS:
${reference_info}
   - Check for a References or Bibliography section in the paper text
   - Report the number of citations/references found (e.g., "The paper cites X references" or "The paper includes a bibliography with approximately X entries")
   - If references are numbered [1], [2], etc., count the highest number you see
   - If no references section is found after checking the entire paper text, explicitly state "No references section found in the provided text"
   - Do NOT claim there are no references unless you have verified by searching the entire paper text for a References/Bibliography section
   - If the paper cites many works (50+), mention this as it indicates the breadth of related work covered
   - Include a brief "References" section at the end of your summary reporting the citation count

11. TECHNICAL COMPREHENSIVENESS - CRITICAL FOR DEEP ANALYSIS:
   - Include KEY EQUATIONS: Mathematical formulations central to the paper's contribution, with notation explained (e.g., "The free energy is defined as F = U - TS where U is internal energy, T is temperature, S is entropy")
   - Describe ALGORITHMS: Step-by-step algorithmic approaches, not just high-level descriptions (e.g., "The algorithm first computes X, then optimizes Y using method Z")
   - Document MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS: Theoretical basis, assumptions, and mathematical framework underlying the approach
   - Detail EXPERIMENTAL SETUPS: Specific configurations, parameters, hardware, software, datasets used (e.g., "Experiments used dataset X with N samples, trained for Y epochs with learning rate Z")
   - Provide COMPARISONS: Quantitative comparisons with baseline methods (include specific metrics: "Method A achieved 94.2% accuracy vs 87.5% for baseline B")
   - Explain MECHANISMS: How the proposed method works at a technical level, including the mathematical or algorithmic steps, not just what it does
   - Include COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS: Computational complexity, time/space requirements if discussed (e.g., "O(n log n) time complexity", "requires O(n²) memory")
   - Document VALIDATION: How results were validated, statistical tests used, significance levels (e.g., "Results validated using t-test with p < 0.001")
   - Include ARCHITECTURE DETAILS: For ML/neural network papers, describe model architecture, layers, activation functions, training procedures
   - Be COMPREHENSIVE: Include technical details even if they seem dense - readers need this information for deep understanding
   - Avoid surface-level descriptions: Instead of "the method uses optimization", say "the method uses gradient descent with learning rate 0.001 and momentum 0.9, optimizing the loss function L = ..."

Begin your summary now. Remember: NO repeated sections, NO repeated paragraphs, extract SPECIFIC claims with CONCRETE details, include TECHNICAL DEPTH (equations, algorithms, experimental details), and accurately report the number of references. Aim for 600-1000 words of comprehensive technical content:"""

7. CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS - NO SPECULATION ALLOWED (ENHANCED):
   - ONLY list items EXPLICITLY NAMED in the paper text
   - DO NOT list items that are NOT found in the paper - this is CRITICAL
   - DO NOT create entries for common items (Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall, MSE, Google Colab, AWS, MATLAB, R, etc.) if they are not explicitly mentioned
   - For each item you list, provide the EXACT QUOTE or specific text from the paper that mentions it
   - Format: "Item Name (exact quote from paper) – \"quote text\"" or "Item Name (exact quote from paper) – mentioned in [section]"
   - NEVER infer tools based on methodology (e.g., don't assume PyTorch for deep learning)
   - Verification: Before listing any item, search the paper text for its explicit mention
   - NEVER use words like: "implied", "likely", "potentially", "not explicitly mentioned but", "probably", "may have been used", "suggested", "inferred", "assumed"
   - NEVER guess or infer tools, frameworks, datasets, or methods based on context or prior knowledge
   - If a tool/framework/dataset is not EXPLICITLY NAMED in the paper, DO NOT include it in your list
   - Example format: "PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – \"PyTorch version 1.8.0\"" - ONLY if the paper explicitly states "PyTorch version 1.8.0"
   - Include specific names, versions, and details ONLY when explicitly stated in the paper
   - Be precise with technical terminology - use exact terms from the paper

8. COMPREHENSIVENESS AND SECTION-LEVEL REPORTING:
   - Extract ALL relevant tools, frameworks, datasets, and methods that are EXPLICITLY MENTIONED
   - Include both standard and custom solutions that are EXPLICITLY NAMED
   - Cover all aspects: algorithms, software, data, evaluation, hardware - but ONLY if explicitly stated
   - Prioritize items that are central to reproducing the research
   - CRITICAL: If a section has no items found, write "Not specified in paper" at the SECTION LEVEL, not for individual items
   - DO NOT list individual items with "Not specified in paper" - this is incorrect
   - CORRECT format for empty section: "## Evaluation Metrics\n\nNot specified in paper"
   - INCORRECT format: "*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – \"Not specified in paper\""
   - If you find items, list them with quotes. If you find no items, state "Not specified in paper" for the entire section

9. FORMATTING:
   - Use clear markdown structure with sections
   - Use bullet points or numbered lists within sections
   - Include specific details (versions, sizes, names) ONLY when explicitly stated in the paper
   - Maintain technical accuracy - quote exact text from the paper when possible
   - Format: For each item, include the exact quote or specific text that mentions it
   - Format: "Item Name (exact quote from paper)" or "Item Name - mentioned in [section]"

10. VERIFICATION (CRITICAL):
    - Before listing any item, verify it appears explicitly in the paper text
    - Search the paper text for the explicit mention of each item before including it
    - If you're unsure whether something is explicitly stated, DO NOT include it
    - When in doubt, exclude rather than speculate
    - Every item must have a clear, explicit mention in the paper text
    - Do NOT list items that are "commonly used" or "typically associated" - only list what is explicitly named

11. FORMATTING EXAMPLES - CORRECT vs INCORRECT:

CORRECT FORMAT (items found):
## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "PyTorch version 1.8.0"

INCORRECT FORMAT (DO NOT DO THIS):
## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – "Not specified in paper"
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – "Not specified in paper"
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – "Not specified in paper"
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – "Not specified in paper"
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – "Not specified in paper"
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"

CORRECT FORMAT (no items found):
## Evaluation Metrics

Not specified in paper

## Software Tools and Platforms

Not specified in paper
